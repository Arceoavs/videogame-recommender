7;;Dont even dare to hope for state-of the art graphics, a proper balancing, professional voice acting or breathtaking script-writing. This here is 100 pure trash, an adventure / shooter hybrid with gazillions of bad jokes, dozens of pop culture references and a hidden, dense net of subversive, intelligent messages related to post-WWII-politics. Oh yes, you need a basic knowledge of pop culture to enjoy the game, and quite some education on politics to really love it, but who cares?;6613;Dont expect a good game here;;6;;Trash of the year.;648;3298
8;“Dark Souls” is not for the weak. The game is based on figuring out various secrets and different weaknesses of enemies, and will play with your patience if you rush through it. It’s not a game for everyone. The most important thing to remember is this, take your time and figure things out. You will be frustrated during some fights but when you finally win that tough boss fight after 5, 10, 20, or even more tries, you will feel a true sense of achievement.;Prepare to die, die, repeat. This short little recipe is something that you will encounter very often in “Dark Souls”. “Dark Souls” is a role playing game in which you play as an undead journeying through the unforgiving dungeons and forests of Lordran, a land filled with skeletons, zombies, ghosts, fiery demons from the very pits of hell, tormented souls of long lost warriors, and many more. The land is dying and it is up to you to save it, although that might not be very clear to you. “Dark Souls” doesn’t hold your hand nor does it give any detailed guidance, it just gives you vague information on where you are supposed to go and lets you on your way, which might not be very appealing for less hardcore newcomers. The game tells you a short little backstory at the beginning to set the mood and it is up to you to figure out the rest of the lore through short dialogues with rare sane NPCs and by reading little bits and pieces of lore from item descriptions.   The story isn’t the only thing you aren’t given on a silver platter, the combat can be very difficult if you do not take your time and carefully analyze your enemies and the situation at hand. If you don’t you will find yourself having to backtrack quite a bit since checkpoints are fairly limited. The controls may take some time to get used to  The first few hours of playtime will be the most difficult as you get accustomed to the controls and the combat itself, but do not falter, as the game progresses, and as you acquire new skills and items, not to mention learn a few neat tricks, you will feel much more empowered and, with enough practice, cut down your foes with ease.   The game itself can be very lengthy, depending on your skill and the amount of exploration you put into it. Personally my first playthrough took me about 45 hours, and if you feel that is too short, the game offers you the ability to play again in “New Game+” in which you keep all your current equipment and level and start again with harder enemies, although I found the game to actually be easier on NG+, well except for the bosses, which were still hard as hell, but thats all part of the fun.  If you see it, you can visit it. Visually the game is something to marvel at. Not only are the visuals very detailed and rich, the atmosphere is just superb, and the level design is one of the best I have seen in some open RPGs. Everything is beautifully and logically connected to each other, which isn’t the case for some other RPGS. The game doesn’t offer you an in game map but don’t worry because you won’t need it. Even if you don’t have a good sense of orientation in game spaces, you won’t have any problems finding your way through the game.   You are not alone. “Dark Souls” offers a very useful and challenging multiplayer mode, which is active while you play the singleplayer story. Let me explain. When you play your game and are online you will be able to find little notes left behind by other players, these notes can offer you short tips on how to prepare for what’s ahead or they could just be outright lying to you. Additionally you can see ghostly apparitions of other players every once in awhile when you are roaming through Lordran. If a player dies you can find their bloodstain left at the scene of the incident, then you can click on it to view the death of said player, cryptic. But the most important part of the multiplayer is summoning and invasions. Lets start with invasions. Any player can invade any other players’ game. When you are invaded you will be given a warning that another player has invaded you, they will then appear as a ghostly red apparition. It is then up to you to fight of the enemy invader, or die, depends on how good you are. Although it can be a bit of bitch if haven’t practiced your parry and riposte, which are a good way to ease up the combat if you can get the hand of it. The second part of the multiplayer is more cooperative, summoning. Any player can summon another player via soapstone’s, this feature can be used to help your friends out with difficult boss fights, or they can help you in the same way.;2155;Dark Souls, an open worldish RPG developed by From Software, released in 2011.;>Targeting system can pose problems >Difficulty wont appeal to most players >Unforgiving PVP invaders can be a real pain;12;>Rich and detailed world >Fun and challenging multiplayer >Diverse and spectacular boss fights >Rewarding combat system;Prepare to die, die, repeat.;609;3087
9;Overall though, it was loads of fun. I had fun playing it. Its worth the ten dollars. A nice challenge thats a nice clash of Cartoon Network characters.;Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion was almost a direct copy of Super Smash Bros. The game had so many things that SSB had that it was funny. From recovery attacks, to special and basic attacks, to assist trophies, and bubble shields. Even lots of little things. Final smashes and Chowder had the cook ability just like Kirby. In SSB you can throw a Pokeball and have Wobbuffet flail around. Shnitzel from Chowder did the same thing. Its not bad that it did that. But they did forget a few things. Like when youre fighting an enemy, it shows your characters damage counter and lives. But it doesnt show the enemies. Which I dont know if Im doing well or not.   The controls were a bit difficult to figure out. But like any game I got used to them. However, there are these extra shooter challenges and its difficult because they made it a pain just to aim and shoot. But going back to the standard fighting part. That was very difficult as well. Which is great. A game should make someone rage because of its challenging. Even if it is Cartoon Network.  They also forgot a few characters. For a Cartoon Network game, they needed to at least have Johnny Bravo and Courage the Cowardly Dog. Those two were some very successful characters in the Cartoon Network community. Johnny Bravo was at least an assist trophy. But no reference at all to Courage. Or Ed, Edd, & Eddy, and Camp Lazlo. I understand they have so much room but they could of made it.   Also as far as the story goes. It was great. It would of been nice to have the characters say their whole dialogue rather than say a common phrase and make us read. And some characters didnt have the same voice actors they had in the show which if you are a fan of any of the shows, it sounded off. They got the narrator to say all of his lines.;2798;This game was lots of fun. I like the clash of different characters fighting games. This one was good but if they spent a little more time and effort it could have been amazing.;Mini shooter challenges were bad.;37;Loads of Fun.;It was good but it could have been great;169;3322
10;“Tomb Raider” is a game that has its ups and downs. It’s a nice addition to the series, but it doesn’t offer enough to make me want more. The game doesnt really have a clear focus, the story doesnt offer anything rememberable, the characters are forgettable,  the combat is very basic. Survival would be the focus if Lara had to do more surviving and not have an unlimited arsenal of weapons and no fear for her own safety. All in all, its an okay game.;A survivor is born, and it grows up to be a bloodthirsty killing machine. “Tomb Raider” is an action adventure in which you take the role of the legendary Lara Croft and survive on a mysterious island after being shipwrecked in a storm off the coast. The island is full of dangers and it is up to Lara to face them, find her friends and escape the island. As you may have already known “Tomb Raider” takes place as a prequel, this being Lara’s first “real” adventure. So this opened up possibilities for greater character development for Lara since little was known of her beginnings before. And it starts out very well actually, we see Lara for what she is at the moment, an actual frightened human being, who was thrown into a situation she didn’t even ask for. She just wants this nightmare to end. At one point she is caught in a trap and has to fight off hungry wolves using only her bow and arrow, the entire sequence is quite intense and fun. She is even thrown into a situation where she has to kill a man in self-defense, which would be a terrible and traumatizing event for anyone. In Lara’s case that event lasted only one cutscene, and after that here comes a shitload of killing sprees. This was the point when the character development just goes down the toilet. There is no transition from “oh, god… what have I done” to “COME AND GET ME YOU BASTARDS!”, yeah very subtle transformation, didn’t even notice it, did you? The jump from self-defense to outright murder is just way to quick to be realistic. There is even a scene where Lara has to jump into a river of blood to escape her captors, when she emerges there isn’t even a whimper on her side, she just shrugs it off. The character development was the main grudge I had with the whole narrative department,  I didn’t even mind the basic plot, to be honest I wasn’t really expecting anything spectacular, just enough to get me from point A to point B.   But story isn’t everything, gameplay is very important as well. So how does the game hold up in the gameplay department? Not bad actually, not amazing, but fun enough to keep you going. Combat is the same thing you’ve seen in every other third person action adventure shooter, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s actually good. Lara has a standard assortment of weapons with the obligatory survivalist bow, which is fun to upgrade, and a neat little climbing axe she uses for, well, climbing and of course killing. Another addition to combat is her “survival instincts” which helps you pinpoint enemies you can’t see.  While the mechanics are functional there is another aspect of combat, which is very important, difficulty, and this is another thing I’m just mad at. On its hardest setting the game is just way to easy, there is little to no challenge when fighting enemies, the only times when I did manage to get killed were when my whole screen was filled with enemies all rushing to blow my face off.   To put it shortly, it didn’t feel as if Lara was in any danger, it felt as if it was an obstacle to pass. But there is great side activity that keeps your mind working, tombs. These fun little brainteasers brake up the monotony, and there is just the right amount of them. The game offers a neat little level up screen and an upgrade bench but that feels a bit rushed, and a bit unbalanced, you will find some upgrades completely useless and some you will just abuse.    Okay, so you get how the game feels, but how does it look? Amazing. The game looks amazing. The environments are very diverse and detailed and some scenes were actually breathtaking. The first time you exit a cave and see your ship on the beach of the island was very reminiscent of the moment you leave the vault in Fallout 3, it’s the kind of moment that lingers on and on.;1164;Tomb Raider is an action adventure developed by Crystal Dynamics and released in 2013.;>Terrible character development >Way to easy for a game about survival >Uninteresting and basic story >Forgettable side characters >Upgrade system could have been better;12;>Tombs are fun and challenging >Amazing visual presentation, with diverse environments;A survivor is born, and it grows up to be a bloodthirsty killing machine;609;3078
11;Well this game was fun but it could be so much more than it is now. It left a sour taste in my mouth but is overall Fun and exciting to play but suffers from many issues;STORY (7.5) The story attempts to tell a tale based around the movie and should take place after the movie. It adds in new characters never before seen in the films such as King-pin, Carnage, and Chameleon. The story does have a few weird parts such as it taking place after the movie but having electro still alive and Harry not affected from the goblin genes. The story does also have some flaws like having just a bad ending and Hyping up carnage to a Sub-par Battle  GAMEPLAY (6) The fighting in the game is fun, Beenox did fix issues with the leveling in the first game sadly though they ruined the game by adding a hero/menace system. Mostly everything goes bad if you dont have time to save civilians in 5 different tedious and boring mini-games, which damages item collectors that take time to search for comic books in the game than save the people of Manhattan, Now it may sound like im whining but wait until you have to fight electro and have everyone in manhattan mad at you for not saving a cat. The  stealth is obviously much more better and so is the camera angles (No more motion sickness). Web slinging is fun and feels fluid most of the time, sometimes you feel like you are not going fast enough or Spidey wont web onto a wall that is right next to him.  Graphics (8/10) The graphics engine used for TSAM 2 makes it shine but there are several issues such as Texture popping, and Dull Textures. Plus on the xbox 360 version the depth of field is really bad. Most of the spider suits you can unlock look absolutely incredible and Electros boss fight looks 300 times better than in the movie  Sound (5/10) I FOUGHT A LOSER LIKE YOU BUT HE WAS BETTER x10. They need to record more dialogue because that is what you are going to hear the whole game, Other than that everything is still the same from amazing spider man 1 the game;4755;After the failure of Edge of Time and the decent TSAM 1 the fans of spider-man needed a true game and Beenox pulled all of their stops to create a new exciting spider-man game.

12;(Verdict)  Alright so heres the line-up  STORY:6  GAMEPLAY:9  GRAPHICS:8  SOUND:9  RATING:8.5 GREAT!;(STORY 6/10)  SPOILER ALERT! The story involves getting sent to steelport in a wild accident when robbing a Protected bank. As cool as it seems it is abit generic and kills off JOHNNY GAT no!!!! Later on you have to choose from 2 crappy endings,Yes They are both crappy.   (GAMEPLAY 9/10) Gameplay is very great. The way they changed the guns play and driving alot makes the game feel much more beter There is also now made new fighting system which has quick time events. The missions are fun and over the top fun! Like professers genkis S.E.R.C.! The only downside is the city is very shallow and cars and people appear out of thin air. (GRAPHICS 8/10) Very Detailed and beautiful. The lack of clothing upsets me as how detailed the clothes and tattoos look. Next the guns look great and has Cool looking bullets coming out. Then again it looks to cartoony. (Sound 9/10) The guns sound great and even running does too. the cars engine sounds beautiful.

13;Overall the game could of had a better combat system. And some things were just weird and backwards. But it kept me entertained at work. So its not all the bad.;This game is backwards. To begin with the story. There isnt much to spoil. You get four different dinosaurs to get through five stages. These stages are all the same. And they a tad glitchy. Nothing to the point of ruining the game though.   The four dinosaur categories are predators, hunters, defenders, and chargers. Now defenders have terrible defense but great attack power. That is a bit backwards. The chargers are just bad altogether. Hunters and predators are about the same. And what the game allows you to do is upgrade your dinosaur with badges or something. But it doesnt feel like the badges really do anything. It may be a placebo effect.   The combat system needs some work. Its just mashing the B button mostly. But once you get further in the game it makes you try using their cruddy but still effective push and super dino attack stuff.   The 3D is actually rather good. The tail of the dinosaur sticks out of the screen a bit. The game has that.  As far as sound goes. Dinosaurs roar. And thats what you hear.  And the custom dinosaur thing is the best part about the game. I made my T.Rex have flames. You could make a fierce looking Barney.;6752;This game is backwards and strange. It has very little to offer. But if you have nothing else better to do, it can help kill a few hours.;-Combat system needs work -Backwards and weird stuff;37;-Custom dinosaur feature was neat -3D was pretty good;This is a dinosaur game.;169;3441
14;This game is fun is you go at it with no shame and an open mind. If you want to enjoy it, you will. If you want to hate it, you will. It is a girly game. But guys like throwing parties too.;The story was completely unrealistic. It was sort of a dating simulator where when you talk to people you have to match the right color. So know how to make colors. You only control the party. Now it can get rather intense when youre deeper into the game. The party guests get grumpy when you dont give them what they want. Which the grumpiness of the guests will make you lose the game.   The graphics are cartoon and with cartoon it can be difficult to tell if the graphics are good or not. They werent ugly cartoons so overall it had good frame by frame clearness.   The sounds are music, dings, and beeps. They sound great.   The actual party part is lots of fun. Planning the party is fun and controlling the mood of the party is fun. Also while playing this, I noticed that all the pictures on the back of the box are not in the game. So that was that.;5989;There isnt much to say about this game. Very basic yet entertaining for a few hours. I beat the game without killing the DS battery and the battery wasnt on full charge. It didnt even get low to the point of red.;-Could of been way crazier;20;-Good story;My super duper sweet 16;169;2885
15;Overall the game was great. I really enjoyed it. The only real downside is the short story.;This game was so much fun. Its for the 3DS. But there is no 3D feature which isnt a problem. The concept is that you are a cube ninja that has to go through mazes to get to the end and save the day. But you have to tilt the 3DS in the direction you want the ninja to go. The ninja can fall in every direction. Its pretty neat. But it is not easy. It does give a really good challenge. With fire and spikes and flying cutter guys you have to evade. And when you get to the end you fight a giant monster. It can get one to rage rather hard.  The story was sort of there. They added text to tell you what why youre doing what youre doing. Which was okay. But there were only five levels. Each level had 20 courses to go through. But overall it felt short. Very short. It was like Wow, That was it?   There also is a custom level feature that I got super pumped about. It was a bit confusing to use but given enough time it can be figured out.  The graphics were good. Nothing ugly looking. Everything was a cube.;6754;Cubic Ninja was loads of fun. I had a blast playing this game. Very different from other games and super challenging.;-Short story;37;-Loads of fun -Great graphics -Challenging  -Different;Cubic Ninja is great;169;3447
16;I really enjoyed this game and I recommend you try this out at least once;It was a very entertaining and challenging game. It was really well made and had great graphics. It was also very addicting and made me want to rage, so I am glad there is a rage quit option;6783;I just played Rainbow Hippie and it was humoring;The controls were hard to get used to;34;I liked the colors and the rage quit option;Entertaining Game;158;3450
17;With stunning visuals, noticeable improvements in motion capture, and seamless and flawless gameplay mechanics, Ground Zeroes more than justifies the price of the game.   I had purchased the game for $30 but I have played it for 7 hours already, tempted to go through the game again to see if I could use a better strategy or go completely unseen by enemies The Side missions are equally enjoyable, with many easter eggs and homages to previous games.  This game is a must have for newcomers to the genre to understand the beauty of Metal Gear Solid.;When I started the game, the first cutscene was astounding.  Previous Metal Gear Solids had a camera angle that represented movie cinema cameras, gradually panning/zooming or stationary camera shots.  In Ground Zeroes, the camera represents a persons point of view, which made me feel like I was, for example, walking with Skullface across Camp Omega in the opining sequence.  Another thing about this game is that its friendly to newcomers to the stealth genre/game series.  There is a reflex mode which allows the player to quickly kill/tranquilize the individual who saw the player (Big Boss) before alerting the base.  You can switch that off if you wish, for a more realistic experience.  The lighting in this game is simply spectacular.  In one of the interviews with Hideo Kojima (developer/director) he said that the lighting will be enhanced to also encompass a stealth aspect.  He was not lying.  Big Boss is easier to spot in the light, and can crouch behind small rocks to protect himself from big towers, with large searchlights.  The gameplay is extremely fluid as well.  Going from crouching, to crawling, to walking is simple and seems realistic as well.  Metal Gear Solid 4 had that same feature, but it is done much better in Ground Zeroes.  I love the fact there is an opening and ending cutscene, and pure gameplay in between.  One of the biggest complaints gamers had with Metal Gear Solid was the fact that they had to stop playing every now and then to watch a cutscene.  Now, you dont have to worry about that. An added bonus is that all of the cutscenes can be skipped at will.  The biggest complaint of the game is the short time.  The main mission took me 70 minutes to complete on Normal for the first time, then 85 minutes on Hard.  Thats just 1 of the 6 missions available.  Trust me when I say that time is not an issue here.;5328;I have been a hardcore fan of Metal Gear Solid my entire life.  I was both eager and skeptic of the announcement of Ground Zeroes.  I understood that it would be like a prologue to the real Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, but I didnt understand the price point.  I got it on release date regardless, because I was swayed when I saw the trailer to Deja Vu, the now multi-platform DLC;Dialogue can be done a bit better (repetitive lines) Some textures where lower-res than others;48;Gameplay was amazing. Cinematics was Hollywood-level Music was exceptional;Ground Zeroes;531;2532
18;Overall Animal Crossing New Leaf has got everything down. Everything is fixed. It is one of the greatest games you can have for the 3DS.;Animal Crossing sort of has a story. You pretty much beat the game when you completely pay off your house and in this game you have to make your town the best it can be.   Now paying off your house in New Leaf is great. In the previous games you get stuck in Tom Nooks terrible debt system where you get rewarded with even more debt. This game, however, allows you to not be in debt. You pay it off as you want.   Fishing and bug catching are pretty much the same. Obviously they have added more bugs and fish. But the controls and stuff are the same. But they work with no complaints. Slingshot gets the balloons down. This I actually preferred in the previous games. Because in older games you shoot down a balloon and get furniture. Now in New Leaf you only get Balloon Furniture which I personally dont like. So I sell it. I preferred the random any furniture. They did add a new thing of diving. Which now you can get a wetsuit and swim in the ocean and dive for underwater creatures that arent fish. It is a neat thing.  The shops are figured out. Nooks Homes sells house remodeling and upgrades to your house. Able Sisters have a third sister that sells hats and facegear. And you can talk to Sable and get QR Codes from the interwebs. Which is really neat. Tom Nooks nephews run the store that sells the basic goods. Same thing though. They upgrade as you buy more stuff from the store. Kicks has a store now that sells shoes and socks. Which makes your character super customizable now. Plus you can buy pants as well. Club LOL is the club you unlock which gets Shrunk and KK Slider. Its fun to just chill in there. The Museum is a museum. You can unlock a second floor and get four new rooms. Dream Suit and Shampoodles. Cool stuff. Also in the town they added the Re-Tail place which is the best. Thats where you can sell stuff to and sell furniture to villagers.   Public works projects are meh. This is sort of the bigger things that annoy people. For all the cool stuff, a villager has to come up to you and ask for it. Which feels so unlucky.   Speed run is not possible. There are two ways to play Animal Crossing. First is letting the game run and wait days and days for things to happen. Or you time travel which can get a bit clunky and confuses the game. But its a legit stategy. The game is run by year. So at Christmas there is snow and Santa and all that good stuff. Same goes with all the other holidays.;2687;Animal Crossing New Leaf is a great game. Its calming but still loads of fun. Compared to the last three, this one seems to have everything figured out.;-Balloon furniture -Villager public project requests;37;-Divning -Graphics -Sound;There is no speed run;169;955
19;Overall I love this game. There is so much to have fun with 10/10;This game has the first good Guitar Hero story. All the others had lame stories were you start as a garage band and get money to be famous. Playing the songs over and over didnt tell it well. But in Warriors of Rock you are a Warrior of Rock. You have to battle it out and turn the characters into beasts to save rock. Its great and super challenging. You still play the songs over and over but it feels like there is more of a purpose to it. Plus you can get your score all the way up to 40 in quest mode.  The biggest downside is the WoR guitar. Ive had two stop working. And the drum cymbols break quite easily. In Quickplay. Thats were the game really is. I spend hours on quickplay. Pick and choose songs. Play on drums, guitar, bass, or vocals. If youre lucky enough to get a full band then you are having a great time. Its so much fun playing songs with friends and tripping them up. Guitarist tries to trip up singer with a girl singer but the singer chooses DragonForce and all is good. There are competitive games to play. Me and my friends only played them for the achievements. But they are fun.   Online is a little weird. I had an instance were my friend was on guitar and before the song started it put him on drums which kicked him out and we all had to restart the game. And the online store just got taken down. Which Im super sad about.   There are also custom make your own song. This part is difficult to figure out if you dont know much about music. And youre able to post your song on the board and people all over the internet and can try it.;2629;I love this game. I have so much fun jamming out and rocking like a crazy mad man. The first Guitar Hero to have a decent story. Plus hours of quickplay with multiplayer. And everything makes it so much fun.;-faulty equipment -a little laggy -took down the store;12;-Great set list -clear rock strip -loads of fun;I love this game!;169;567
20;Overall Ultimate I Spy was very enjoyable and killed a rainy day with my family. The game is great to play with a group of people and only one controller. Expect for the mini games. They kind of kill the group effort part. But in general its a really fun game. You just have to want to play it.;I Spy is really fun. There are about 10 levels and 4 parts to each level. Just like the book, each level gives you a riddle of things to find throughout the level. You are able to move about the level unlike the book. Looking high and low for dogs, rabbits, birds, and everything.   There are also mini games that you have to find as well. These games range from all sorts of cheesy but amusing things to do.   The graphics are not super realistic. But it gives it the I Spy feel. With some really neat level designs.   As far as sounds go, it had typical music that fit with each level. And there are two announcer voices that sound clear. That game is rather clear throughout as far as dings, blings, and beeps go.;5252;If you enjoyed I Spy books as a kid or now, then youll enjoy this game if you give it a chance. You have to want to play it for it to be fun.;-is a little off with the motion controlled mini games;5;-fun with a group -challenging;I Spy a great game.;169;3591
21;I think this game is great. It kills lots of time. Its lots of fun.;Tomodachi Life is loads of fun. There isnt too much of a story. Its mainly helping the people or Miis out. These things vary from making them friends to helping them sneeze. I personally dont like helping them sneeze. Its rather bleh. Compared to some of the other stuff they ask to do. They all play mini games with you which are amusing. And you do unlock new areas and other stuff when playing. The talking sounds very robotish. But they will say anything that is not a bad word. Its rated E. So the rap battles are so clean its hilarious. I do wish there was a better way to control the relationships between the characters. The game pretty much decides. And this is from friendships to lovers. All of it is random. The one character went friendless for the longest time.;6403;Tomodachi Life is great. I just got this game and the day has pasted by super fast. Its great. Me and all my friends living on an island.;-Sounds robotish -not much control over relationships;37;-Will say anything (aside from bad language) -Loads of fun;Its a great game;169;3618
23;“Diablo 3” plays and feels like an offline MMO, and that isn’t bad, on the contrary it offers something very much needed for any couch co-op console gamers. The gameplay is addicting and fun, even though it could use a bit more polish on some elements. A must have for anyone looking to spend hours upon hours with their friends.;Evil has risen, for a third time. “Diablo 3” is a role playing hack and slash game in which you take on the role of the Nephalem, chosen warriors that will fend off the evil of Hell itself.   At the beginning of the game you are offered a selection of 5 classes, Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Witch Doctor and Demon Hunter. Each of these classes offers a different style of play as well as their own unique skills and abilities. The Barbarian is a standard tank/DPS class, which is the same as any other warrior class. The Wizard is a full on DPS, whom uses a diverse set of ranged spells. The Witch Doctor is another spellcaster whose main strength is the ability to summon minions to fight for them. The Demon Hunter is a ranged DPS that uses crossbows and longbows as well as an assortment of traps for tactical combat. And the final class, the Monk is probably the most interesting class  it’s the only class that can be used to fill any of the standard MMO roles (DPS, Tank, Healer). The Monk uses short ranged spells and melee attacks to fight its enemies as well as passive and active healing abilities to aid their allies, and can also have a decent amount of health points as well as armor points.  The game starts off with the falling of a star through a cathedral, which is found near the town of New Tristram. This event sets off a chain reaction that causes all of the nearby dead to rise and attack the innocent inhabitants and, as you might have guessed, it is up to you to save them and investigate the site of the fallen star. Not to spoil anything but it does get a tad more complex then that later on.  Now, “Diablo’s” story isn’t very complex, it’s actually quite basic when you look at its barebones, but they do cover those bones up very nicely with rich lore and interesting backstories. Most of the boss encounters are built up with great stories of their horrific powers and evil deeds.   But the story itself isn’t really something that will leave you wanting more, it’s the gameplay that will make you want more. “Diablo 3” brings a well-crafted combination of fun and challenge to the table. The controls transfer very well to the console versions, even though the interface could have used a little bit more work, but we’ll get to that later on. The combat is fast paced and quite easy to get the hang of for beginners. The addition of the dodge and lock on controls are what make the difference. Dodging becomes a very important part of the combat in some situations, as you really need to maneuver a lot, and lock on really helps the ranged players when they’re trying to pick off targets in large clusters.  The game features a total of 8 difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard, master 1-5) and 4 campaign modes (Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno) each more sadistic than the last. And if you’re a real masochist you’ll love Hardcore mode, in which you have only ONE life the whole game, so um yeah, good luck with that. The games main strengths come from its spectacular boss fights of which I thought were too little, a total of 10 (can’t remember the exact number) true fights. The first few felt a bit lazy and weren’t very creative, but by the end of Act II they start getting better and better. Beating the main campaign on the 1st mode unlocks the 2nd and so on. So to get the most out of your game you will probably go through around 4-5 times. But you’re probably thinking “Why?”, well that’s exactly what I thought at first and then my first legendary dropped. That moment is something that any “loot whores” like me will love, it’s basically the same effect as beating a dungeon boss in an MMO and getting to see what he dropped. This obviously won’t work on everybody, but it’s very easy to get hooked on the concept, especially if you’re playing with friends. Even though the looting is fun, you still have to level up to use it. Now this is where I thought the game really simplified it too much. There is no choice in leveling, you get all the skills you can use at certain points and variations to those same skills, but there is no talent tree which most players have come to love in the old “Diablo” games.  Which brings me to the most important addition of the console versions, offline 4-player local co-op. This was the prime reason I got the game, to play with my friends. Now this might not seem like a big deal, but it is for anyone that enjoys couch co-op and hack & slash RPGs. It offers that feeling of exploration and questing with your friends in an MMO, especially once you get to the bosses. Co-op also offers the ability to quickly devise tactics and create combos. Having your party with you will really speed up the combat and make it easier and fun, and just to keep it challenging, I’d recommend pushing the difficulty up if you’re gonna play with a full team. But that all doesn’t mean that multiplayer is perfect. The camera can be a problem at some rare moments and could get you killed a couple of times and at some larger clusters of enemies the frame rate will drop a bit. But the main issue I had with the game was the inventory management in multiplayer. Dear God, this can really take a while since only 1 inventory screen can be open at a time, and the inventory itself can be a bit of a bother since all of the gear is based on wheel and comparing items does take a while even when you’re alone.   The entire game is from a 3D isometric point of view and is filled with a range of different environments, from the dark forests of Tristram to desolate deserts and Heaven itself. However the game doesn’t offer much in the way of enemies. You will mostly be fighting similar undead or demonic enemies throughout the entire game, although the game does have certain enemies that are specific to their regions but the problem is in their skillsets, most of them will have the same strengths and weaknesses, despite the fact some of them are completely different monsters. When you reach Inferno and ramp up the difficulty, the elite enemies will have multiple additional skills, which will make the combat a bit more interesting, but most of the time the difficulty comes from the enemies’ numbers rather than any real increase in power.;120;Diablo 3 is an action roleplaying hack & slash game developed by Blizzard Entertainment and released for consoles in 2013.;>Basic story >Multiplayer could have used more polish >Weak leveling system >2 or 3 more class options wouldnt have hurt;12;>Rich lore >Spectacular boss fights >Fun combat and addictive loot system >4 player co-op >Varied and random environments help with the replay value;Evil has risen, for a third time;609;3083

28;Overall, Mario Kart 8 is magnificent. One of the best in the series. Truly worth a buy and an afternoon or all nighter.;Mario Kart 8 is great. They fixed a lot of annoying factors. When you fall off the edge in previous games, that cloud guy would pick you up and slowly place you down on the road. By the time you got to start racing again you lost your lead. In Mario Kart 8 that guy throws you onto the track. You still get the shame and penalty of falling off. But it doesnt let you lose that much of a lead as you would of in previous games.   Others things that are neat are the weapons or items. The horn can finally counter the blue shell. It really comes in handy. There is a weapon that gives you all the basic items which is awesome. And other new items to use that are neat. Im always in the front. So like older Mario Kart games, the items are better the more you get behind.    The graphics are incredible. The whole driving on walls and upside-down is really neat. It doesnt mess with your racing at all. Its just really neat. And beautiful. I mean really. The scenery is so eye popping. So much activity going on around you as you race through the various race tracks. 10/10 of graphics. It really is great.  Sounds great. Nothing wrong with the sound. And online works smoothly.

30;Minecraft is one of the greatest games. Its the greatest creative game yet. Not complex. But it can be if you want it to be. Anything is possible in Minecraft.;Minecraft is great. It is a legendary game. It doesnt really have a story. I played the Xbox 360 edition so forgive me if they added more PC stuff. BUt the story is find the End Dragon. Kill the End Dragon. Which is optional. Its all how you want to handle the game. This game has two modes. Survival and Creative.    Survival mode is where the game lets you survive through your life living off the land. Its best to play with friends but same things happen either way. You start a world. And everybody starts chopping trees and/or digging mines. Both are important but are still over done. Then everyone forgets to make a farm until they start getting hungry. Then one or two guys will build a farm or find a village. Then night comes around and this first night will really kick the game off. Because if the guy mining didnt find iron to make shears then nobody can get a bed. So you bury yourself underground to hide from creepers and other mobs.  And the game is pretty much like that. Slowly gather materials to build your house. Then have an endless supply of cobblestone and dirt. Then you look at the clock and see that 15 hours have passed. Its time for bed or play through the actual night.  Creative mode is a lot different. You are given everything. You can build what you want and do want you want with an almost endless amount of options. If you can think it, you can try to build it in Minecraft. And some of the things are just beautiful. From pixel art to replicas of Zeldas castle. Anything can be built in creative mode. No dying.   The graphics are graphics. I hear people complain about how terrible the graphics are but the game wouldnt be the same without the blocky pixeled look. Building with blocks is the purpose of the game.  Sounds. The soundtrack in my opinion is depressing. Sad piano music. Not sad as pathetic. Sad as crying. I turn the music off and play my own tunes. The sound effects are sound effects. A pig sounds like a pig. A cow sounds like a cow. Good stuff.;121;MInecraft is great. So many great things have evolved from this incredible game. So many memories with friends. And so many adventures and hours killed while playing this game.;-soundtrack;12;-creative -lots of fun -kills time;Where do I begin with a game this legendary?;169;575
31;Overall it was a good movie trivia game. If you like movie trivia its a good game to get for a bargain. I played alone but I assume playing with a group of family or friends would be great.;Scene It Box Office Smash is a quiz/trivia game based off the board game. It is fun if you like quiz/trivia games. Which most people I talk to are not. I am though. And movie trivia is the best. Now there is no story. There are three different game types. Short games and long games. Which are both the same except short games are well shorter. Custom games I didnt try out. I looked at it went on to the other two options.   The questions are little games about movies. However, they ask about more than just the movie. Which whether youve seen the movie or not, cant be answered from just watching the movie they ask about. For instance, theyll show a clip from Little Miss Sunshine and ask you what one actor did in a different movie. Or who was the music done by in the movie. Which if you read the credits of a movie, you can find out. Most people just look at the cast, director, and producers. And some games have nothing to do with movies. The Anagram game where it shows a jumbled up word that is a movie or actor. It can be a bit rage worthy if you get those questions.  Online gameplay. I am the only person in the world playing this game. So therefore I was not able to connect to anyone. So I will never know how the online play is. The achievements were relatively easy to get. It gave the game a bit more reason to play.   They did have a different controller device for the game. I got the game used for cheap and I didnt get it. But using the regular Xbox 360 controller wasnt any different. It worked great.  The graphics were Xbox Avatars and cartoonish aside from realistic movie clips and pictures. There are no Disney movies at all. Thatll help your answers. The sound was good. They got announcer voices from movie trailers to talk to you throughout the game. Which was neat.;7181;This game is a game. About movies.;-weird questions -Im the only one playing;12;-announcer voices -Good choice of movies;I have scene it.;169;3816
32;92/100 igdb rating from me, well deserved. One of the best games I ever played. This game gave me 45 hours of fun. I highly recommend the series to rpg fans, though probably only rpg haters will not have fun with it.;First Impression  My first impression was actually not that good. The intro movie is quite okay, not outstanding. The controls were strange and feeling kind of annoying and some of the mechanics did not suit me well. If this is the case for you aswell, I urge you not to give up in the first ten to thirty minutes. Play the tutorial, read the tutorial and finish the prologue at least! I got used to the controls, the interface and the mechanics slowly, but I did. And I really really did not regret to play through the accommodation phase.   Story  (No spoilers) Most important thing first. The story was intriguing. Of course every RPG has some sidequests that are not that interesting, but there were interesting ones as well as funny ones. The main story was superb and hits my top3 (which is not exclusive to games). It even made me buy the books, which I will read while waiting for witcher3.  The story is dark and mature. Monsters, Crime and mystery fit very well in to the dark setting and there is some very original stuff in here. There is romance and sex. There is gore and death not only for monsters. The dialogs all make sense and there are even some really hilarious comments from various characters. So there is funny stuff, but comedy is on a tight leash. For me it was just the right amount.  The story does even have some twists that I could not foresee.  The story alone is enough to get me hooked on the franchise. There is a lot about the past, and a lot about the now known future (Witcher 3), so the story feels evolving. 10/10   Graphics  The Witcher 2 has its own engine. It does the job it was made for quite well. Everything already looks very good, even a few years after release. I cant give this top rating though, since it is not at the todays optical standards.  There are also some problems with the engine. I did encounter some strange optic glitches in texures, that however did not really bother me. Here and there are some not important objects, mostly for looting, that I just could not use (loot), and the disablility to jump is just feeling weird. Nothing stopped the flow of the game though. Keeping in mind that the company still didnt have that much experience at the time I see these as quirks of a still new engine and have the highest hopes, that the new installment for witcher3 will not only look (extremly) good, but will also miss these. For settings the only thing I missed was borderless window mode. Everything essential was there.  Now the level design, the scenes and most of all the atmosphere was incredibly good. Everything just feels right, there is so much detail in the design of the environment and the clothing. Even the swords on your back a held properly and do not just magically float on your back. Also the npcs get on with their lives and do stuff depending on the time and situation. It just feels alive. 8/10   Audio  Very nice and fitting music. Slider for music, dialogs and game sounds, which is all you need, but you will need to adjust them correctly. Standard settings pretty much made me not hear the important dialogs. If you get it right the atmosphere auf the audio is as good as the optical one, enabling you to loose yourself in the game completely. The only time it fails, is when a lot of npcs stand together and talk all at once. Especially in the prologue this was annoying, but wasnt noticeable often later in the game. The soundeffects were not annoying at all, which in modern games is not really a matter of course apparently. The voiceacting, which is for every npc and the player character, was really really good, too. I enjoyed listing to some of them quite a bit. It was not perfect all the time, but still really good for a game. 9/10   Controls  The controls were the hardest to come around to. It took me more than half an hour to get used to the controls and the fight-mechanics, but after that everything was well. There are not many keys you actually need and you just dont have to think about which button to press after some time. You just do. I do not think that it matters much, if you play on keyboard or with the controller. I decided to go with the keyboard, because Im just more used to it. The settings for controlers had everything I think someone could need. I did not have to change anything. So even with the long accommodation phase... 10/10   Fun  I had a very good time with this game. Lots of fun. It was epic, emotional from time to time and quite challenging. The quests were intersting and had just enough diversity. Some fights are a little bit frustrating and you have to find the right tactic to do it, but its more rewarding to beat something, if you lost to it a few times before, right? One or two times it ended in boring hit&run, but since that happend very rarely its fine. In theory this game even has a high replayability. There are a lot of different game endings, two destinct decisions that will change the course of the game quite a lot, and even some dialog options alone tempt to just reload and try the other one. Its still a roleplaying game, though. For me that means... once the story is done, it is done. This is the way it happend, everything else is wrong! It is fun to talk to friends how the story differs from their experience though! The good thing is: you can go on with your savegame in witcher3! So the story as it happend to you will go on exactly as it was for you. This is the same with witcher1 and 2. If you played witcher1 (recommended) you will notice it in witcher2! 9/10;478;This is a fantastic game and will probably stay in my top5 for a long time. After I saw what The Witcher 3 looked like I remembered I had fun with the first game and started with the second installment. I just finished it yesterday, so I am rating and reviewing this, while everything is still fresh in my memory.;- long accommodation phase - minor glitches (graphic) and problems (looting) with the engine;6;+ Story + Atmosphere + Voice actors and dialogs + Mature fantasy setting + long: 45 hours playtime for me;The Witcher 2 – Assassins of Kings (Enhanced edition);126;3818
33;Star Fox 64 3D was great. Story was really short but you can play it over and over and not get tired. Certainly a good game to bring back an old friend.;Star Fox 64 3D is great. Ive never played the original. So when I played this 3DS version I was shocked on how short the story was. Like wow. Really. That was it. I was planning on bingeing all day on this. But I beat it in an hour or so. It was indeed  a good story. Dont get me wrong. The story was great. It was just shockingly short.   There were other modes. You can play as the new 3D graphics story. Or play with the original 64 look. Which is nice. There is also the multiplayer which is neat. And score attack.  The graphics were great. They kept it looking original but with a higher quality. More visually stunning. The 3D looked good. It certainly makes the game more difficult. Depth perception. I turned 3D off during the gameplay for most all of the game. But the cut scenes I kept it on.  Sound was good. Nice to hear the Star Fox theme. The character voices were nice and clear. I can clearly hear Falco being a jerk, Slippy yelling for help, every five seconds, and Peppy telling me the controls the other five seconds. The characters are as true as the internet joked around they were.;6890;I played this game. Shamefully I have to admit Ive never played the original 64 version. So all of this was pretty much new to me. And I thought the game was great.;-two sets of credits. one for the original and one for the 3DS part.;37;-Star Fox -nice graphics;I played this game;169;3823
34;Overall, Costume Quest is a great game. I enjoyed playing it. Its the best Halloween game.;Costume Quest was so much fun. It was hilarious. This kid has to rescue his sister/brother depending on what gender you choose. And you get friends to help you defeat all the monsters who take candy. And you go door to door and get candy from the people. And the animation for getting candy is crazy. Just boat loads of candy dumped into your candy bag. It feels so great knowing that I got 10,000 pieces of candy. The story behind it all is great too. Lots of fun and interesting things that make this the perfect Halloween game.  The combat was neat too. It was turn based but it was good. When you are in a costume you turn into the real thing when you battle. Its so neat. And they have some pretty wacky costumes as well as traditional monster costumes as well.   Graphics and sound were good. There is no talking. Just reading text. Which at the beginning doesnt let you read at your own pace. It shows you words that you have to rush and read which I dont like. Graphics were cartoons so you cant complain about not looking real. But it still was great. Nice detail and design.;5637;I loved this game. It was so much fun. Best Halloween game ever. Really got me excited for Halloween.

35;This game is awesome. Certainly worth playing.;This game is so awesome. I love it. And just because its South Park doesnt mean it was easy. It put up a good challenge. It had a great story that pointed out a lot of things we do when we play video games but just never noticed. And poked fun at other video games and there nonsense. If you like South Park youll like this game. If you dont like South Park you might like this game. Thats how good it is. The story was a bit short. You could probably rent it and play the whole thing. But it was still awesome and hilarious. And it is so crazy. It really feels like an episode of South Park. Even the graphics look exactly like South Park. Its great. And it sounds great. Characters are obviously great. And collecting all the Chinpokomon.;1262;South Park: The Stick of Truth is wonderful.

36;It is a great game that is now certainly a classic. I just havent gotten to play it until recently.;This game is old. But it still is fun. Its a really nice challenge. A good puzzle game to play for an hour or so. The graphics were actually really good. For SNES it was really clear pictures and gameplay. It was more for Yoshi. He was in the game a lot. As a background picture. But still. He is in there.   The game is just switching blocks until you match three of a kind. Or more. It has the area like Tetris and Dr. Mario but it moves up slowly.   The sound is clear. The music is really pleasant. It doesnt get annoying after awhile. It stays nice.;2739;This game I got thinking it was a variation of Tetris. It was not. But that doesnt mean that it wasnt fun. It was lots of fun.;;19;-Music -Yoshi -Passwords to return to where you were when you start back.;This isnt Tetris;169;3826
37;This game certainly worth a try. I am still having a blast playing. It isnt what everyone thinks. Its lots of fun. If you like electronic music even slightly. And even so the gameplay is fun on its own.;DJ Hero is a blast. I had so much fun, and still am having loads of fun, playing this game. Its not what everyone thinks. Saying that its only rap songs. There are rap songs. But this game shows thats not what being a DJ is. It really shows what being a DJ is. Blending two songs together for a really neat beat. And they are not all rap. They have Queen, Jackson 5, and other not rap songs.   Also this game had a great tutorial. Comparing to the Guitar Hero tutorial for any instrument. It was meh. But DJ Hero had a great tutor. Grandmaster Flash teaches you step by step how to play DJ Hero. DJ Hero is easy to learn but difficult to master. I only play on medium right now.   Which brings up some other stuff. You do not fail a song. At least I havent yet. The game has setlists of four songs to play continuously. After each song it shows your score and goes on without you having to press A to continue. And there is lots you have to do in the song. Pressing the buttons, scratches, the switch thing, then the optional but recommended dial turner (Much like the whammy bar in GH), and other things that dont know how to explain in just words. And you can get a friend to play along with another turntable or as a guitarist. So your Guitar Hero buddy can play guitar while you DJ it up.  The story is not really a story. Just play setlists to unlock the next setlist. Which a game like this doesnt need a story but it is neat to have a bit of a background story. Theyve done it before.;2679;This game is so much fun. There is always talk about the strangeness of this game. Well Im here to say that it is great. Also I got a good deal on it. Less than $10 for both games and turntable. But thats not important. It is fun though.;-Not too much of a story -Wishing there was a third. Next gen.;12;-Great setlist -Great gameplay -Loads of fun;I am the DJ Hero;169;3953
38;All in all, the focus for the game is definitely off-point, providing minor/pointless additions while failing to provide exciting gameplay or the most requested features within the main game modes. The weakest fifa title to date, and a massive disappointment as a long term player.;Im having a guess here, and that guess is that the release of the next generation of consoles is largely why fifa 14 for the Playstation 3 is such a mess. Ive been playing football (soccer) games since 1998 and can confidently say this is the worst football game ive ever played. The gameplay is laggy and broken. Glitches are everywhere. matches are far too slow, players far too clumsy and to put it bluntly the game is no longer enjoyable. After finding a near-perfect formula in fifa 13, EA attempted to modify the gameplay heavily and in doing so have completely ruined it.   Outside of the matches themselves, the career mode changes have slowed down manager mode to the point where its now a chore rather than fun. Its tried to take a step towards football manager and has now ended up in a poor middle ground that doesnt cater to anyone. I enjoy football manager games and the depth they provide, i also enjoy fifa games and the simplicity they bring. I wanted more involvement as a manager, but the new transfer system is far too awkward and tedious to use. The old scouting system provided enough depth while not being too much of a hindrance or slowing things down too much. The new career mode attempts to be a sim but doesnt pay enough attention to the important details to be one. There is still too much erratic behavior issues (injured players complaining that you arent playing them) and broken areas such as player growth that fifa still cant seem to get right.  Ultimate team has seem some additions, but theyre still missing the collection book, which is an omission that is far too frustrating for a collection based game mode. The additions and changes that were made were minor, and still sidestepped important requirements (improvements to the search function but still no function to avoid duplicates) the lack of legends which were made as an xbox only exclusive is also poor.  The menus are poorly designed and laggy as they have been for quite a while now, while lots of the information displayed is randomly a lot smaller than usual, which makes it effort to actually read player information or make decisions.;2920;The copy-paste template suffers from next-gen preparation once again.;Gameplay is slow, laggy and frustrating Career mode has been made tedious Ultimate Team still lacks requested features;9;New south american leagues added;Awful;234;3021
39;Overall I enjoyed DJ Hero much more the DJ Hero 2. It was quite a disappointment considering how much fun the first one was.;DJ Hero 2 was not as much fun as the first DJ Hero. Mainly from the most important part. The setlist or songs they chose. They were boring. I prefer more upbeat music I guess. DJ Hero had classics but modern yet still great music to play. Daft Punk, Little Richard, Grandmaster Flash, etc. And the songs that I wasnt really into I still could enjoy playing. But DJ Hero 2 went in a more serious way in what music they chose. They did have some good and neat stuff. Like The Prodigy and Axel F. But then they used so much Lil Wayne and Kanye West. Which if youre like me. I dont enjoy them at all. And it was so much of it. And the songs that I didnt know on DJ Hero 2 were not making me feel any better. DJ Hero was more classic hip hop. DJ Hero 2 was more R&B and modern rap. They had some classics but their mixes were not as good as the first DJ Hero.   They did add new features. More freestyle of everything. Freestyle scratches and crossfades. Which is neat. But they grade you on your freestyle. Which is not too bad. It just feels they are looking for a certain freestyle. And they made the rewind better. In DJ Hero you would rewind and it would stop you at a random spot. Which could be right in front of a note. In DJ Hero 2 they made checkpoints that you rewind to so they can put you at a good spot. Which is nice.  They had other modes. Battles, storyish mode, and quickplay. The story is just play this song to unlock the next song. Which isnt DJ Hero 2. Thats just how GH and DJH work really. You play all the songs and unlock more stuff. You always play a few songs you dont really enjoy but you bare through it to go to the next one. I only got so far before I gave up from all the boring music. I didnt care. I went into Quickplay to check what else they had incase I might miss something. I played the songs that stood out and they still werent as great as the DJ Hero mixes. Battles are part of the story. It was whatever. Not good or bad. Its just there.;2680;I played DJ Hero and loved it. So starting up DJ Hero 2 I had expectations. And they were not filled. It was not as much fun as the first DJ Hero.;-setlist;12;-better rewind;It was meh.;169;3978
40;Overall, this game is amazing. One of the best N64 games that was made. I love this game.;Pokémon Snap is great. The story is the game. So its great. You ride around taking pictures of Pokémon. This is for the Kanto Pokémon. You can throw apples and pester balls and use other tools to get Pokémon out from hiding to get a good picture. The reason youre getting pictures is for Professor Oaks research. You unlock things as you go through the game.   One thing about the game that is sort of bad. But not really at all. Once you find all the Pokémon, the game gets easier and easier to complete. I complete the game in less than a day. I see my friends play and they go crazy. They arent very good at it. They see Moltres and take so many pictures of it. You only can send one to Prof. Oak.;2324;This game is so much fun. Ive beaten it so many times. Its great.;-there hasnt been a sequel yet;4;-Loads of fun -sounds good -pictures are good;Say cheese;169;609
41;Gemini Rue belongs to the general knowledge of every classic adventurer, in the very readerly sense. If youre not an adventurer but a real gamer, youll probably want to consume this creamy cake in place of a novel instead. Dont expect a Deus Ex, but a Philip K. Dick with a click.;This jewel has a paper wrapping: its outward appearance comes from the early 90s, with the difference that the designers are well aware of their works generic conventions. This makes Gemini Rue an extremely pleasant piece to play, watch, and listen.   The interface is simple, yet enables puzzles that make progress uncertain, just enough to make you feel youre challenged. The pixels are simple, yet the neo noir atmosphere is as smooth as the monkeys in the Caribbean. The audio... well, its not simple but simply awesome  the voice actors are pro and the music is pure Blade Runner -- the game version (1997) of which can actually be considered as the closest relative to Gemini Rue as a whole, not least in quality.   I wont spoil a word about the story (and if youve played this you know it anyway), but let me make one thing clear: this is one of the few classic adventures that actually makes a thematic argument worth further discussion elsewhere. The only clear flaw in this landmark is the lack of hotspot lighter, albeit theres no actual pixel hunting involved. Who knows, perhaps this deficiency is rather a feature that refines your cyber detective work into an even more intense experience?;6325;As the sophistication of videogames in general moves on, the sophistication of classic adventures in particular... moves on the level of writing standards.

42;Overall it is a good game. Single player is great. Online still needs some work but its fun to play.;Grand Theft Auto V single player story was incredible. It was so much fun. The missions were fun. The story was great. Lots of crazy action. Trevor, Michael, and Franklin are all great and hilarious in their own way. Plus all the side characters are great as well. Lots of collectables to collect. Lots of missions to do. The graphics were great. It sounded good. Great music selection for the radio. I listen to all the channels if I find something. And the game music is really good too.   Then here is the online. Okay. Online was great. It still is great. But playing it now for so long everybody is getting tired of Rockstars nonsense. Its sort of a never ending cycle. Rockstar promises Heists which will give out lots of money. Because all the missions now give very little money. Its not worth peoples time unless you are super committed. But Rockstar also gives us the option to pay actual money for in game money. They made it sound like an optional thing. Which it is. But nobody is buying there virtual money. They break the game to get money faster for free. Free is better. But Rockstar wants their money so they have to patch the glitch over and over again. However some of these are not just glitches. They have a survival mission at the carnival place. Which was the really fun survival that people liked because they cool destroy. There was one spot that was behind a dumpster as cover. So now I have a good chance of completing. Well I guess I wasnt the only one who did that because Rockstar went out of there way to remove that dumpster from the game. That annoyed me. They keep fixing the fun stuff.   Thats just that nonsense. Their are lots of good things in online as well. Thats just the biggest issue. Customizing cars is lots of fun. I personally like getting one car from each class and decking it out for the races. They also added a create your own game option. Which is neat. There are a lot of restrictions. But its Rockstars first attempt so Im not complaining. The mini games are fun. I think I was the small percent to buy the game for golf, tennis, and darts.   The bad things about online, aside from earlier. When you are in your apartment for too long the game freezes. Which they still havent patched. And after playing the game for so long with my friends we noticed things that are really just pointing out. Doesnt add or take away from the game. Like when you sit on your couch, your character sweats uncontrollably. And he/she sits so uncomfortably. Also online is more fun to play with friends. Playing alone is rather boring.;1020;GTA V is great and has lots of problems at the same time. When games get really big like this people tend to tear it apart. It is a good game.;-Rockstars money nonsense -Freezing in the apartments;12;-Great story -Fun online;This is a game;169;1054
43;I dont know why, but I couldnt stop playing this game when I did, it has a very addictive gameplay and a nice graphical style. Its just so fun, progressing in this game! But dont buy it unless when it is on a deal. Its not that it isnt worth it, but you can get it for a buck(et) when the time is right.;Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood is a self acclaimed cartoon-style third-person shooter. It has about 10 complete levels, over 10 weapons, and a customizable character. There isnt really a story in this game, you are a part of the French Foreign Legion, an international wing of the French army (not necessarily the French one, look it up at Wikipedia). Except for the You take the role of a last-standing hard-boiled Legionnaire taking on an entire rebel army, from the official description  and the title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with any Foreign Legion army. The rebel army, you ask? Same story as in the title, doesnt come back in the game, only a few words in the description. In the 10 missions there are different challenges, from protecting some oil pipes, to a last stand mode. With each kill you make, you get tons of blood, all this blood is counted in buckets, for every bucket you get around 1 dollar and a (very) little bit of XP. You also get a reward in accordance with the difficulty level you play on. With this money you can buy weapons, clothing and accessories (after unlocking them depending on your level). This makes a pretty decent system, but still nothing special. After completing a level, you unlock the next, of a variable set of maps. With a fantastic level at the end! The game itself is a little bit glitchy, but not that you feel it. Its a shame that there isnt a multiplayer, but for that, you gotta play the next game in this serie: FoL: Multi Massacre. Multiplayer and Foreign Legion feels like bread and butter, if you know what I mean.;7521;Hello, Im Dantonse and I want to share my opinion about Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood, a Sakari Indie game.;No Story No Multiplayer;6;Arcade based fun!

44;“Far Cry 3” is easily one of the best FPS singleplayer experiences I have ever played, with the variations in all of the gameplay elements it offers, it certainly shows how an open world game should be, and if it had a few more elements in certain areas, it might have even been called an RPG.;Up there you thought you had it all, but down here, you hit the ground.  “Far Cry 3” opens with a very short little music video (by short I mean under a minute) introducing our main characters and showing their arrival on Rook island, and their little get together with the main antagonist Vaas Montenegro. During the intro sequence you escape Vaas’s encampment and meet up with the Rakyat, the natives of Rook Island. They tell you that you are the chosen warrior that will defeat Vaas and bring glory to the Rakyat. And basically after you complete a couple of tutorial quests, you can go on and explore the island (to a certain point until you have to progress the main plot).    So what do people do for fun around here?  Well quite a lot of things can be done here. The two main side objectives would be the outposts, which need liberation and radio towers, which need activation. After doing one of those two things more side quests will open up and complete enough of these and you will get recreational activities such as: knife throwing, target practice, poker and island racing. Which are nice ways to make a few bucks or just have fun. In addition to these activities you also have Trials of the Rakyat, a total of 12 challenges in which you must use a certain weapon to kill as many enemies as possible before the timer runs out. This is the competitive leaderboard portion of the main campaign.    Why have one island, when you can have two?  The game is split into two large islands, which are both beautiful and detailed to make for a great exploration experience. The northern island populated by the Rakyat and Vaas’s pirates and the second controlled by the troops of Hoyt Wolker. Visually it’s more of the same and gameplay wise the only difference between them is that the enemies on the southern island are a bit tougher. In a nutshell, the first/northern island is where you gear up and the second/southern island is where you put that gear to good use. Even though this isn’t bad, most of the elements from the first island will be forgotten on the second one for most players. By the time you reach island number 2, you will have gathered most of the equipment you will need and will have crafted all of the holsters and bags.   Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?  Its doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, a pretty simple definition, but it’s also how I would define the gameplay in “Far Cry 3”. Now, this doesn’t mean the game is repetitive, far from it, it means that it offers new ways of approaching old objectives. The best example would be the outposts which you have to liberate, of which there are a total of 34. Basically you have to reach the outpost and kill all the guards, and that does sound repetitive, but “Far Cry 3” offers you multiple ways to do that. You can stealthily take out all of the guards before the alarm is sounded, charge them head on, lure wild animals to attack the guards, or just burn that motherfucker to the ground while listening to “Make it Bun Dem”, and many more ways you’ll have to find out for yourself, either way you’re going to have a lot of fun doing it.    Once you clear an outpost you will not only be rewarded with experience points and money, but with new missions, three types to be exact. WANTED: Dead, a straightforward, find the target, eliminate the target, but you must always use a knife when doing so, such is the tradition of the Rakyat. Path of the Hunter, hunting mission in which you hunt various animals with a predetermined weapon. And finally Story quests, these are short little missions, which are given to you by certain NPCs and are always something different.  Another element that offers a great deal of variation is the modes of transportation. On Rook Island you have the option of using cars, trucks, boats, jet skis, hang gliders or the awesome wingsuit to travel around the island.  Full synchronization.  While there is an uncanny resemblance to “Assassin’s Creed” in the way that you can climb atop tall radio towers to activate them to reveal a portion of the map during which you get a little cutscene showing off some of the landmarks in the area. There is also one element in which “Far Cry 3” reminds me of “Assassin’s Creed” and that’s in the stealth elements. Now, while there aren’t haystacks in which you can hide or conceal bodies, stealth plays a major role in the game and is encouraged more often then one would think. Which can be seen by the increased amount of experience points you get when completing a mission stealthily, as oppose to completing it loudly. This is something that could have been rushed or poorly executed quite easily, but it wasn’t. Stealth has a certain depth and variety to it. You can use silenced weapons, the bow, or just takedown enemies up close, and over time when you get newer abilities you will be able to adapt your strategies and make them better and more efficient. Use the foliage as cover and sneak by enemies, cause distractions by making loud noises at certain points, disable their alarms so they can’t call for backup.   Now the question is, are you motivated enough to do all this?  Yes. The game does a good job at motivating you with its fine story and interesting characters. While the main plot is straight forward  save your captive friends and get off the island, the depth comes from its cast and character development. Vaas is easily one of the best villains I have had the pleasure of facing in any game, although he was underused, having more of him wouldn’t have hurt the game, and it would have actually made it better. Jason, our main protagonist, is just an average rich boy looking to have fun with his friends, but Rook Island changes him in ways he would have never imagined. Driven by the psychotic mind games of Vaas, the manipulation of the Rakyat, the pure adrenaline that comes from all of the near death experiences, and the difficult choices he must make to save his friends. Citra, the “leader” of the Rakyat, promises you power with which you can fight Vaas, but it all comes at a price, which will ultimately decide your fate. Hoyt Wolker, Vaas’s boss, feels a bit underwhelming, rushed and not developed very well when compared to Vaas, one of the less memorable characters “Far Cry 3” has to offer. Now without going into detail/spoilers about the ending I’ll just describe how it turns out, essentially it’s just press LT for this ending or RT for that ending, this is the only time you get a choice like this in the game, and feels very out of place and just slapped on to make players feel like they have a choice in the matter, which really wasn’t needed at all. Unfortunately, whichever ending, I found them both a bit unsatisfying in comparison to the whole game.  You don’t have to go it alone.  “Far Cry 3” offers multiplayer along with it’s great singleplayer experience. The multiplayer aspect consists of competitive and cooperative modes. I didn’t play the competitive mode so I’ll only be talking about the cooperative portion. The co-op mode is comprised of six missions in total and can played with 2-4 players (2 – player local split screen and 4 – player online/system link), and this really came as a surprise to me. I didn’t think the game needed co-op, but that was before I had a chance to try it out. Across the six missions I found that the same variety that was available in the singleplayer campaign made an appearance here as well. The missions have different objectives, which you have to complete, but also have a small competition section that is different in every mission. This really came out of nowhere and added a fun way to complete an objective whilst competing with your friends.;529;Far Cry 3 is an open world first person shooter developed by Ubisoft and released in 2012.;>Meh ending >Some side activities lose their purpose with time >Hoyt feels rushed;12;>Large, varied and amazing open world >Great story >Amazing cast of memorable characters, especially Vaas >Variety in gameplay >Fine soundtrack;Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?;609;4013
45;Well however they have done it, they did it well. Possibly its my desire to kill all humans and possibly because I love tricky little strategy puzzle games but I give this game a good 7of10.;Overall the game is pretty simple, or is it complicated?

48;Terrarias both fun and addictive, but the sheer amount of information and micro-management required can cause parts of the game to become tedious and frustrating, making it fall just short of being a perfect game in its genre.;Terraria appears to be quite a simplistic game at first. I would assume the majority of players first played Minecraft to some extent and figured theyd try what appeared to be a sidescrolling version of that game.  While everything seems straight forward for the first hour or so, it wasnt long before i realised just how much depth there is with this game. Theres a lot to it, much more than i had anticipated. Worlds within worlds, lots of different environments, enemies, weapon types, spells, armor and items to keep you entertained and occupied. I usually dont like to compare games when reviewing them but i think many will draw a comparison to this and Minecraft, and personally i find this to be much more combat and adventure focused rather than the sandbox/building focus that lies with the latter. For me personally, thats a good thing. There are a dozen or so bosses and they all pose different challenges and can be fought in different ways. The world itself feels very alive and as so much of the game is random different playthroughs on different worlds can provide many hours of entertainment.  There arent too many major flaws with the game itself. Controls can be a bit awkward (on PS3 at least) and there is the occasional bit of slowdown and lag, but nothing too severe. My only real problem with Terraria is the negative aspect of the huge amount of depth within the game. I find myself having to use the wiki or a guide most of the time i play, as every hour or so you find yourself with a bag full of items that can be pretty confusing as youre never really sure what to do with it all. You have to build houses for NPCs and storage space for the many items that youll need on your travels. Bosses normally require summoning along with an arena of some kind and specific items/equipment to get through, all of which takes time and can be incredibly awkward. The challenge of each boss is good, but the sheer amount of preparation beforehand detracts from the experience somewhat. I find myself spending a lot of time micro-managing items and manipulating the land itself just so i can do x y and z before finally doing what i originally set out to do. While playing i sometimes just wish everything was a little bit more straight-forward.;1879;;Amount of items and features can be overwhelming Micro-management becomes tedious Controls can be awkward at times (PS3);45;Massive amount of depth Variation and randomness between playthroughs Enjoyable, balanced challenges throughout;Great;234;4215
49;This game was not the greatest game. What was good about it couldnt make up for what it lacked. Worth a try.;One of the biggest issues I discovered with this game is that there is no save feature. I unlocked the second tour but it didnt save. So when I restarted the game. It was gone. Plus when I played the second tour it froze on me. I gave up at that point. Plus the other things.  The very little track variety. When you race there are plane races, boat races, and of course car races. These are all neat in their own way. And when I unlocked more vehicles they stayed unlocked. But the lack of track variety was a disappointment. There were 4 worlds. Each one had a track for all race styles. Frozen ice world for all boats, cars, and planes. Same with the other three. So when playing the tournament there was really no surprise of a new looking track. I wanted to see the entire Hello Kitty world.  The graphics were Hello Kitty friendly. They were not the greatest but they didnt subtract from the games fun. And the music was great. Nice Hello Kitty cheerful music. So in this aspect the game was fun.  Overall the driving and racing was fun. Not very intense but still entertaining if you give it a go.;7463;I got this game without any big expectations. But it still didnt do that well. Lots of things that held the game back from being brilliant.;-doesnt save racing progress. -lack of a variety in race tracks;41;-Music -plane races;Hello Kitty wasnt too pretty;169;4439
50;Rogue Legacy is a very fun platformer/rogue like hybrid that provides a good challenge and a lot of entertainment. The shortness of the game and lack of a truly random experience do detract from the overall package, but its a game that i would definitely recommend others play.;Rogue Legacy is a platformer + roguelike fusion. Its a whole lot of fun and provides a great challenge along with it. As the player you will be dying a lot, but strangely that doesnt take any enjoyment away from the game. As a matter of fact dying is such a focal point that it actually improves the experience. The punishment for deaths is spot on, and playing through the game with different classes (which directly relates to the deaths you suffer) provides different options and challenges. There are some traditional rpg elements (such as character improvement and equipment) but its all very straightfoward and doesnt get in the way of the fun stuff. The game is designed in a way that you cant just charge into an area sword first, hoping for the best. Each room is randomly generated and each obstacle/enemy requires a different approach.   The art style is very nice in my opinion, everything fits well and both the enemies and bosses are well designed. Its a game that you can pick up and play for 15 minutes or alternatively lose a few hours if you have them to spare. Theres nothing too flashy going on (which is to be expected from an indie developer) but i do feel thats a positive. Nothing detracts from the gameplay, which is a nice change.  On the negative side, there are a few minor issues. playing on the PS3 the game constantly crashes when trying to exit to the XMB. i think only once in 10+ times did i manage to exit successfully. The game is rather short, and although it is lots of fun, before too long players will be facing the same rooms with the same enemies and the fun is reduced somewhat. A gameplay gripe i have is that there is no way to look outside of your current screen, which in a very difficult platformer is a bit of an issue. There are rooms where you have to fall a large distance and you have no way of knowing where enemies/spikes will be on the ground so it becomes a guessing game. Its a shame because everything else in the game is so fair and based on a players skill that it feels cheap when you find yourself falling right on top of enemies, however the game is still enjoyable despite these problems.;3221;;Crashes on exit constantly (PS3) Game is rather short, psuedo-randomness  No way to view outside of the screen - can make luck a big factor;9;Fun, simplistic gameplay that is also a great challenge Nice sprites/artwork Randomly generated dungeons;Good;234;4672
51;Overall. Dont waste your time. This game could of been great. But it was really bad. Play it on arcade and arcade only. I took it back to the store. I never do that.;This game was terrible. I got in knowing it might be bad. But it wasnt even a fun bad. It was boring and unappealing. No story. Which for a racing game isnt needed. But there isnt a good way to really unlock new stuff. It was originally made for arcade. So it times you while you race. Its a good thing for arcade. But when switched over to home console, it could of been taken off. It just makes it impossible to enjoy.   The controls were meh. They worked barely. It was difficult to drive. Which made the cruddy mini games more difficult than they should of been.   The graphics were terrible. Even for its time. They still were bad. I didnt pay attention to the sound. They played a trucker country melody. Nothing important.;3706;This game was so disappointing.

52;A stable of the city-building genre.;Its old but its the best one out there if you ask me. Even though the graphics arent full 3D they are still surprisingly high definition and it is fun to zoom in close just to look at the buildings. The graphics really do still hold up. I was pleasantly surprised when I played it a while back.  The gameplay is fantastic if youre into this genre although there are a few problems. Some of those can be fixed with mods, which there are plenty of. Theres nothing that would ruin the experience, just some nit-picky things that would make a couple of things easier in the long run. The modding community is great and popular mods are totally worth getting even if some of them change the game mechanics quite a bit. If you new to the genre I would recommend you first play a city or two without mods to get the vanilla experience. For the fans of the genre: mod to your hearts content. You can pull a lot of extra depth out of the game with the right mods.  Depending on how you play once you reach that final stage with your city where everything runs like a finely oiled machine it might feel like youve reached the end. Some may continue to micromanage every little aspect for days to come but I recommend starting a new city. I personally prefer going for a visually impressive city rather than the most efficient one. Sim City becomes more of an information management/puzzle game if you aim for the most productive city. It is more enjoyable to create something visually pleasing.;1275;You will waste days managing your city once you get sucked in. Prepare your calendar accordingly. This among my favorite games of all time. Ive played it for at least a hundred hours.;;6;;My View on the Game;744;4720
53;Fun takes a back seat and Rockstar have let realism take over. While it may be graphically superior and larger than other games in its genre, it falls down in the fun department. Could have been so much better and a huge disappointment to someone that has enjoyed the series for a long time. If you have friends that also own the game and can play online together, this game could potentially be great, but if youre playing solo then tedious gameplay and a barren online leaves a lot to be desired.;Where do i start with a game as big as GTA V?   Firstly, the game is indeed huge. Thats a great thing. The map is bigger than weve ever seen in a GTA game before, and the story (when you add in the side missions) goes on for a damn long time. Added to this, the game has a huge online component, featuring lots of missions, activities and character customization. You can also make and download yours/other peoples missions which provides a bit more diversity when playing. There are lots of minor additions to the game that make things less awkward and are nice touches. Weapon/radio wheels rather than having to manually cycle through each 10 times. A quick save action rather than having to go all the way back to your safe house. Online properties. Special single player abilities depending on who youre playing as. These are all nice features and add to the game. On top of that you have the most realistic grand theft auto game to date. Unfortunately, thats where the problems begin to appear.  For me, the realism in GTA V comes at a price, and sadly that price is fun. There are many examples of how i feel it adversely affects the game, but ill just list a few to keep this review from becoming ridiculously long. Firstly, character switching in offline. It would be a great feature, if it was implemented properly. The problem is that most times when you switch character the new character you switch to is miles across the other side of the map or in a bad situation. (in some cases getting chased by police which is just frustrating)  Its fun and interesting the first couple of times, but as you progress through the story it begins to get incredibly tedious switching and having to sort out your character for 10 minutes before being able to do your originally planned task. Similarly, the game changes your characters out of their clothes. Whats the point in letting us buy loads of clothes and accessories if i leave the character for 5 minutes and theyve changed by the time i switch back? Relating to realism, its far too easy to die in GTA V. I dont want to be invincible, but you can die stupidly quickly in way too many circumstances. You fall down the smallest gap, land on your head - you die. Land a big jump on a bike, leaning slightly back or forward - you die. Car flips - you die. A.I. can mow you down in bullets in as little as 2 seconds, from a damn long way away. It just takes the fun out of it. Im happy to have difficulty in a game, but its difficulty caused by too much realism. I dont care if i couldnt make that motorbike jump in real life, i want to jump off a mountain and land in a video game without randomly breaking my spine. Missions suffer from this a lot too. I failed a mission because i left my buddies behind. wtf!? If im not allowed to leave an area, either tell me first or just invisible barrier me in, or at least give me a warning prompt when i get too far away from my allies. I could go on and on with this subject. Another glaring example was calling a support helicopter, it glitched out and flew away before i got to use it, then when i called they said if im not going to use their services properly ill have to wait, so i had to restart the mission. Needless.  The next issue is the police in this game. The police system is completely broken. I have no idea why theyve messed about with it so much but i never had these many problems in any past GTA. Your wanted level takes ages to go away, police spawn directly in front of you, they see you through walls or round corners, they know where you are even when theyre not supposed to (classed as hidden but they decide to all park directly outside of the alley nobody saw you enter) On top of all this when they do see you theyre like love-children of rambo and the terminator. The police in this game are better shots and more difficult to deal with than any other enemy. The men on the ground are bad enough but when they bring out the helicopters... its just no fun.   To keep this review from going on for pages, ill list the other negatives without providing too much extra info.  Loading times - waiting for the game/online to load is painful. Three characters dilutes story - I never felt attached to anyone and didnt care about the antagonists at all. The characters are interesting but you only get to see them for 5 minutes before you jump over to another storyline again. Weak soundtrack + no custom radio option - Soundtrack doesnt stand up to San Andreas or Vice City, by now we really should have custom radio on consoles. Poor online matchmaking - The online is really fun.. when you can find other players. 16 player races would often end up being 1 vs 1 because the matchmaking system just doesnt work. Cant own multiple properties online - why!? Too many boring missions - drive 5 miles to here, to pick up this, to then go here, to then do this... So many missions felt like chores.  Heists missing from online, single player heists feel too rigid - Single player heists arent much more than regular missions, and online heists still dont exist. Unacceptable. A.I. aiming - Mentioned with the police but it applies to all really. Gangsters with smgs should not be tearing me apart when i can only just see them through a sniper rifle scope. Clunky controls - I dont know how this still hasnt been sorted. The game handles awfully on foot. The character runs around in circles of falls off platforms because theyre just so damn clunky. Unbalanced online - if youre going to let high level players have tanks and rpgs, please dont put level 10s with pistols in the same lobby. Very poor rewards for online challenges - Playing a 20 minute mission solo on hard, killing 30+ enemies and then getting a 10th of a level up sucks. Consant patches restricting the game - This infuriates me. I get patching out exploits and hacks, thats great. However, patching to reduce rewards from certain missions or to remove strictly fun glitches drives me crazy. The online is supposed to be fun and chaotic!  Ill be honest, i didnt enjoy this game anywhere near as much as i hoped i would. Ive enjoyed every game in the series previous to this but the whole thing just felt like effort. I cant argue with the length of the game, but even the content isnt great. I feel that the game tries to pack in all these modes and activities, some of which shouldnt be an activity in their own right (online parachuting? really?) while others are done much better by other games. Id rather play a third person shooter, or a racing game, or a tennis game, or a golf game, than each individual aspect in GTA V. That to me i guess is the main problem with the game. It has a lot of stuff to do, but all of it has already been done better by someone else. The graphics and voice acting are very nice, but that alone doesnt make a game.;1020;A huge release from a behemoth of a series, but does it live up to the hype?;Police system is broken Realism impacts fun Poor online matchmaking Clunky controls Jack of all trades, master of none Sub-par soundtrack Still no heists Tedious gameplay;9;Huge map, long story Nice Graphics Good voice acting;Decent;234;3810
55;The PSP version of Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is sadly a watered down, stripped away imitation of its PS2 counterpart. I dont feel the PSP was necessarily the right platform for such a game and would always advise someone to try the PS2 version instead, which is superior in areas.;I was a fan of Pro Evo around the time of Pro Evo 6, having played all the games in the series previous. This was however the first Pro Evolution Soccer game that i got for the PSP, and i can definitely say that it doesnt work anywhere near as well as it does on the PS2. The gameplay itself isnt as good, with team-mate A.I. being especially painful. I found playing for more than two or three matches could become quite painful due to the positions your hands have to take up while playing, making use of the right shoulder button almost constantly. (I realise this is an issue with the PSP itself, but i have no problems playing any other games on the system as most do not put so much strain on a particular hand position)  Customization options are good (can change teams/players for the most part) but unlike in the main versions of the game you cannot modify which teams take part in the master league mode, which is a disappointing. It almost makes editing redundant as you then cant go on to use the teams & players youve modified anyway. I like the stat tracking in master league and the overall presentation is nice, although It lacks commentary that is included in the console version. The matches feel a lot clumsier and consist more of solo runs and long range shots than team-play and tactics that were present in the PS2 games at the time.;2484;Please note that the following review is for the PSP version of the game.;Gameplay is overly simplistic Poor A.I. (both team-mates and rubber-band opponents)  No Bundesliga, all English teams are unlicensed  No Commentary;38;Fun to pick up and play for short periods Good stat tracking and presentation within Master League mode;Poor;234;5020
56;I got Darksiders while it was free on PSN and although im glad i didnt pay for it im also glad i tried it, as its not a bad game by any means. Worth playing if you enjoy other games within the genre.;I found Darksiders to be pretty average overall. Enjoyable, but average. The story is pretty typical of the genre and did nothing to pull me in, the graphics arent impressive for the date of release and the gameplay is rather simplistic. Its a fun game to play. The combat isnt anything special but works well, while the puzzles throughout the game are (for the most part) well done and add a bit of depth to the game.;1270;Hack and Slash gameplay with a focus on the four horseman of the apocalypse. Unfortunately Darksiders does little to stand out from the crowd.;Nothing that sets it apart from other games in the genre Some puzzles arent intuitive Average graphics Simplistic storyline;9;Combat system works well Nice blend of fighting and puzzles Fun gameplay;Average;234;4866
57;All in all God of War is an enjoyable game and one i would recommend people play. It lacks replayability but is a good start to the series and provides fun gameplay and an interesting storyline. Worth picking up.;The game is definitely fun, i really like the setting and storyline, and its well told as you progress through the game. The main character is incredibly cool and i like the other characters and enemies that feature. There are plenty of puzzles scattered throughout the game with most being enjoyable and well thought out, although there are a few that come across as rather nonsensical and counter-intuitive. As the game progresses you fight your way through contrasting environments which keeps things fresh, and there are quite a few skills to use in combat which makes the fighting in the game feel enjoyable and rewarding.  While the game is definitely very fun, i feel it was a bit on the short side and due to its linear nature this heavily affects replayability. There isnt a pool of characters to choose from or multiple routes through the game so once youve completed it there isnt much reason to go back and play through again other than perhaps trying a harder difficulty level. Where the game has a lot of platforming elements, the camera angles can be frustrating from time to time. Mid-jump i found myself having to counteract an immediate camera shift which is disorienting and cost me my life on a number of occasions which is a shame.;549;I recently played God of War for the first time thanks to the PS3 HD re-release.

59;WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2011 continues the dissapointing decline of WWE games. A massive overhaul is needed to breathe life (and more importantly fun) back into the series. The universe simulation is promising but doesnt do enough to counteract the poor gameplay found throughout.;While i havent watched wrestling regularly for quite a while, i always keep an eye out for the games to see how theyre coming along. I loved the games prior to the vs. series (most notably here comes the pain) and im not sure if it coincides with the programmings decline but ive felt that the games has fallen short for a number of years now and fail to give the experience they should.  A big feature of SvR 2011 is the universe mode. As a simulation, it works pretty well. Coupled with the fact you can create and download loads of wrestlers to help extend the starting roster it makes for a decent game mode. Unfortunately it lacks stat tracking (which in a simulation style mode is unforgivable) and feels quite rigid in terms of the matches that are scheduled and the rankings for belts. The mode desperately needs an option to protect tag teams as i found myself downloading numerous wrestlers and creating the great tag teams from the past only for them to disband two weeks later and start feuding with each other. In the space of two months of simming i had a packed tag team division with 10+ teams deteriorate into a 3 way fight for the title.  It really stopped me from enjoying the mode as the second i stepped away and let the game take any kind of control it ended up destroying everything i had built. Simply providing an option to stop the game from disbanding teams without the players say so would prevent this and make the mode much more enjoyable.  Outside of the simming within wwe universe the game really does fall apart. The gameplay in matches is very sluggish and boring. Control feels clunky and each move is telegraphed. Everything feels like a chore and a far cry from the incredibly fun gameplay of Here Comes The Pain or Shut Your Mouth. Along with this the commentary is awful and might has well of been excluded. Commentators blurt out random lines that often make no sense in relation to what is happening in the ring. It completely breaks any immersion the player may have in a match.  Along with the universe mode mentioned above, the other main mode in SvR 2011 is the road to wrestlemania mode. It functions as a story mode but is incredibly restrictive and linear, much more so than the story modes from previous years. I much preferred when the concepts of universe mode and road to wrestlemania mode were fused into a single story mode. In which you could make decisions and work towards wrestlemania, but also have other fixtures and events going on around you. Its a shame the road to wrestlemania mode was so weak in comparison.;2265;The series continues to stutter, unable to recapture the magic of its PS2 predecessors.;Slow, clunky and tedious gameplay Terrible commentary Story mode is linear and dull;9;WWE Universe offers some simulaton depth Ability to create and download lots of wrestlers can greatly add to the players experience;Poor;234;5110
60;;Although this is a good game, there are many things that could be improved. Such as the many bugs on multiplayer mainly, there are also a few bugs on single player. This games appears rushed and not complete however it is still a good game. I enjoyed it, the storyline is a bit short but multiplayer is a lot of fun..;1979;Im quite a big fan of the Battlefield series.;Storyline was too short. Some sounds were not realistic.;49;Graphics.

61;/...;Grant Theft Auto V is an outstanding game. I have played it on Xbox 360 and I have not had one problem with it aside from the people that cheat to get money and then have a tank a phone call away. This can be annoying at times but is easily resolved by finding another session. Graphics are pretty good for 360, looking forward to seeing what its like on Xbox One.;1020;The Grand Theft Auto series has always been pretty good but Rockstar have once again blown me away with their games.

62;To conclude, really good game. Graphics obviously arent good since it was made in 1997 but it is still a fun game, and I would recommend to anyone that is looking to kill time or enjoys strategy games.;Theme Hospital is a fun strategic game. I enjoy building my hospital up and running it myself, choosing the staff and expanding. Although the game gets pretty difficult towards the higher levels Im still addicted to this game and I m confident that I will one day beat it!;1624;I used to play Theme Hospital when I was a young boy on my old Windows 97 computer. Fun times. When I saw this for around $3 on GOG.com I had to buy it.;Graphics (Obviously!) Story (What story?);14;Strategy Fun Reasonably Realistic;Fun for when you are bored.;343;5127
63;Overall this game was great. Nice and challenging but with not much to do.;This game was a step up from Tetris Attack. Were Tetris Attack for SNES was Yoshi themed. This had the Pokémon theme. Though it went off the show instead of the games. So you were Ash fighting Gary and Team Rocket. And there were several more things to do. There is the new 3D puzzle which is really difficult. Like turning the entire screen in a 360 view. And the different game modes. Standard which is Ash battling his way to the top earning badges and whatnot. There is this Pokémon university thing were it sets up different small sets of blocks to figure out. You have to figure it out in X number of moves. Very challenging. And the line game version. Where Team Rocket take your Pokémon and you need to earn them back.   After you do all the challenges its up to you to go back and do it again. So as far as replay value goes it doesnt have too much.   The graphics were great. Even by N64 standards. The map layout was nice. The music was catchy. Calm thinking music. But they had sound effects that were the same for different characters. Cool at first but amusingly annoying after 20 or so times.;3574;This game was just a newer version of Tetris Attack. The same thing. Dont get me wrong though. It was still fun.;-short activities;4;-great music -good graphics;Tetris Attack Pokemon;169;5151
64;This is a relaxing game. So you want to fight and shoot and kill and see animals eat other animals, then this is not your game. This is for exploring the world around you and having fun with what the game has to offer. Which is an ending ocean. There are boundaries. Even within the big world which isnt that big.;This game had some great features. It is great to just go swimming around in the ocean looking at fish. The game is nice and relaxing with relaxing music and sounds of the ocean. I enjoy finding and learning about all the fish and other creatures. Each creature gets three sets of information about itself. Which is a bit weird on how to retrieve it. The first set you just find the animal and interact with it by shaking the Wii Mote around. Then the next two times you have to come back at different times and interact some more. Weird but not bad.   There is a story. I havent finished the game but I can see the idea of it all. You and Katherine Sunday go on a mission to fill out your encyclopedia with demands from the bossman. Also while out sailing around you get requests from random people to see fish. These guys will roll up in a jet ski and want to see one specific fish. Which is easy enough until they start to whine and complain that we cannot find the fish they want. Hey look a whale and a shark and an octopus. But Im not satisfied until I see a Oriental Butterflyfish. And Katherine Sunday is backwards. She is a marine biologist that cannot swim. And she holds you back from exploring the cool stuff like trenches and caves. Which are just unlockables. And also while on the boat there will be random animals that spawn on the boat. From penguins to a polar bear. How they get on the boat, I dont know. Not bad. Just odd. There are treasures you can find and dolphins you can train. A custom aquarium is there. That is pretty cool.   The biggest issue is that some fish that I have interacted with do not give me the info about them. This really bothers me. Its like seeing a rare wild Pokémon and you cannot catch it because you have no Pokeballs. Only difference is this is the games fault.   The controls can be a bit clunky at times too. You have to keep the Wii Mote facing the screen. Then moving around is not as easy as it could have been. The graphics are okay. The creatures and landscape are good. The people look terrible.;4832;This game was great and annoying at the same time. The idea behind it is wonderful. Education and diving. But other stuff got in the way to make it less relaxing than the game wanted.;-clunky motion controls -not being able to discover fish that are right in front of me. -bad human animation.;5;-relaxing -amusing;The Ending Ocean;169;5154
65;So overall, this game is awesome. Not as awesome as Melee, but still awesome.;This game was as great as Super Smash Bros. can get. The greatest thing this game had from the last two was a really good story. It was really cool. I thought it was the best. Then to add classic mode and all star mode in too. Plus stadium events and games. It was great.   The gameplay was great. It flowed nicely. It was clear. The changes they made were good and bad. New characters are always good. But cutting characters is a tough choice. Or changing a characters attacks. Marios spin move for his down special attack was better than the Brawl version where he pulls FLUDD out and shoots water. It was just better in Melee. But the Smash Balls and Super Smashes was a neat new trick. It gave each character more uniqueness.   And the other weapons are great. I didnt like the timers. I do and always will love the Fan. Its the best weapon in the game. My friends are terrified of me when I get the Fan. The soccer ball was neat. The Team Heal Ball was useless. We rarely played team games. So we never got to really use it. Assist Trophies and Poke Balls are fun. I did like collecting CDs. Trophy collecting is just there. And stickers were useless. They didnt seem to have that much of a purpose and you never know if youre close or not to collecting them all.   The stages were okay. A few stages bugged me so I keep them turned off. Custom Stages are really cool. I love custom stuff. So I have several of them. The music for the game was great. However, I personally dont like the Brawl theme as much as the original and Melee theme.   100 Man Brawl is difficult. You cant turn off items. Which doesnt sound bad until youre at 15 and you have 200% damage. Then a bomb spawns right on top of you and you die instantly and lose all that progress.;1628;I played this game so much I dont really know where to begin. So many things to do.

66;If youre a fan of being challenged, a fan of (hard) platformers OR fan of incredibly good music, this is a must-have.;I have played this game for 5+ hours. Considering the price and the fact this is an indie platformer, 5 hours is a fair bit. For the entire duration of those 5 hours Ive felt the immersion that comes from a good game. The game is appropriately challenging, has a great humor and almost doesnt cause seizures. You wont regret getting it. Although I recommend taking breaks, as your fingers and brain will hurt. After completing the game Ive several times found myself searching for the soundtracks on Youtube.;3151;;-Fingers will probably hurt;6;- Music - Challenge - Humor;Music alone makes this game worth the money;799;5158
67;Great single player game. The ingame score system will make you want to play more.;If youre into assassination, both in computer games but also in real life, then this is a game for you. Hitman: Absolution is a game with great replayability. With the ingame scoring system you will have the stimulus needed to play through it once again. Its all about getting that perfect score. Youre even able to compare yourself to other people who also played the game. If youre like me, youll end up replaying the same level a ton of times to get a perfect try. This system, together with the fact that most (if not all) levels can be completed in several different ways, adds up to being a 2012 must-have.;530;20+ hours played.;;6;-Challenging -Great replayability -Score system;A game for perfectionists;799;5159
71;Overall, Scribblenauts was a great game. It stole my attention from a different game I couldnt put down. It is for kids. But it can be fun for gamers too.;How it works is you have to create things to help out people. You can create almost anything. Someone needs help saving the animals from a zombie. So you can give them a weapon to fight with. I personally like to go as crazy as I can. I gave the guy a weed wacker to fight the dragon. However some things need to be specific to complete the puzzle. Most all of these are just little puzzles to solve. Also you can give them adjectives. Which is really cool too. You have a shark attacking you. Just click it and give it the adjective gone or dead and its taken care of. The game has lots of jokes and references to other things.    The game has great graphics. Cartoons in HD. And the way people talk is through text. But there is talking and the characters say, blah blah blah when they speak. The cowboy that said, tarnations was great.  Controls are great. I played it on Wii U. And you can play the entire game without once looking at the TV. TV just offers music. Which is great. Great tunes to play with. But controls were great too.;2943;Scribblenauts was great. I really enjoyed it. It is intended for kids but with the right attitude it can be fun for adults.;-More options;41;-music -silliness -creativity -references;Lots of creativity and fun;169;5415
72;REALLY GOOD at all!, the history, the grafics, the puzzles, really, everything is relly gawd;well, i really enjoy puzzle games like portal 1 and portal 2 (i finish these 2 games in 2 days) and Q.U.B.E is amazing! is not more challenger than portal, but.. its different. Its really hard for me to find these type of games, and when i see the trailer i think wow, I NEED THIS. i play the directors cut and the normal game, and the directors cut really WORTH to buy it, because it add a HISTORY in the game!  What is portal without an history? Normal! i know, its still good but an hisotyr changes everything, it makes you immerse in the game and FEEL it better. i REALLY recommend this game if u like puzzles, maybe it will be easy for you, or hard, but it makes you break your head, u can get stuck in a problem for 2 hours, take a 10 min break, and solve it in 3 minutes while u are eating a sandwich :v .;5445;Q.U.B.E is an amazing game, with an great story, and i love this type of game <3;need more phases;6;all <3;Q.U.B.E a game about cubes :v;842;5490
73;Overall, Bayonetta was great. I was skeptic at first but now I think the game is great.;Bayonetta was great. The storyline was interesting. Lots of crazy things happened.   The gameplay was great. Hack and slash on giant enemies. The detailing in the enemies and in the characters was incredible. Visually stunning. And the characters were great. Bayonetta herself was sarcastic to all the seriousness of the enemies. Enzo is goofball.    It sounded good. Sound effects worked and the music was great. The graphics were great.  Quiet a bit of sexual innuendo. Thats up to you to decide. Certainly not a game for kids.;2136;Bayonetta was awesome! I really enjoyed this game.

74;Overall, I really enjoyed Tetris Evolution. It was lots of fun if you want to relax and kill some time.;Tetris Evolution is a fantastic new way on Tetris. It keeps the same way of the game. But it gives other options and game types to try out as well. Since its on 360 it has achievements. Which gives it that much more reason to play. But the achievements can be difficult to get. Getting high scores on all game types and then other stuff.   The only achievements that are painful are the online achievements. Online Tetris or multiplayer Tetris is great. However, I am the only person playing this game at the moment. Therefore there is nobody to connect to. So no way to even try and get these achievements. I know this because I convinced my friend to get it. And we both tried at the same time to search for players. We connected to each other. So we were the only people playing. Multiplayer is great though. The very few times I got a chance to I enjoyed it.  And Tetris is customizable. You can pick from several combinations on the background, the frame, and the little icon picture. Even choose what music you want. At the main menu you hear the Tetris theme in a serious way. Which is awesome. The graphics are Tetris. There good for what it needs to be.;2631;This game was great. Tetris is always great. And this version is wonderful.;-Nobody is online;12;-customizable -music;I am the only one playing this game;169;571
75;Overall, Bayonetta 2 is a definite must get for the Wii U. Its so much fun. And its great that it comes with Bayonetta with it. So you can play them in order if you wish.;This game was great. The characters were great. The right amount of seriousness and wackiness needed. Not too serious but witty enough to keep it interesting. The story was awesome. You dont need to play the first one to understand. But it sure will help you get some other details.   The gameplay was like the first one. Hack and slash combos. With weapons to unlock and use. Bayonetta 2 was more difficult than the first one. Not saying the first one was easy. It was just easier.   I didnt try the online stuff out. But as you progress in the story you unlock more levels to use online. I think.  The graphics were incredible. Nice and clear. Made it feel like you were right in the action. And the music was great.;2135;Bayonetta 2 was awesome. Really good.

76;Overall, I loved it. Its a fantastic game to play on Halloween or really on any occasion.;This game was great. The story was brilliant. Not going to spoil anything. But it was awesome. The gameplay was great. And all the costumes were great. I love how they take the goofy costumes and make them just as strong as the rest. The turn based fighting style got better. You can block and counter attacks as well as to double attacks. It was one of the best turn based combat games Ive played besides Pokémon.   The graphics were great. Cartoons were clear and it ran smoothly. The audio was okay. The music and sound effects sounded good. But on occasion there would be this loud scraping sound that blared through. Then went away. Not sure if that is for all games or just the Wii U version.;5638;Costume Quest 2 was great.

80;The game actually has a lot of faults but for 1998 it was mind blowing and special. The nostalgia vortex is kick started with this game and with expectations high for the next Zelda game, the young gamers of the new millennium were about to get their tiny minds blown again... a bit.;Ocarina of time (or OoT for those of us who need to save the precious seconds for more pressing matters) is to many of us the game of our childhood. It follows the endeavors of Link (not Zelda!) who is awakened to find that faeries, talking trees and midgets all want him to leave town and go fight dangerous monsters. So off he trots collecting his signature arsenal of weapons and collecting coloured things until he has enough things to fight Ganon who is trying to take over a world seemingly tailored to give minor obstacles to anyone attempting to go anywhere or do anything. You start off as child link and after some fapping about you get enough coloured things to become adult link in the future using the Master Sword and the OoT. As adult link your gaming experience is refreshed by being able to use different abilities and weapons. After a bit more fapping about you become a bit in-game-nostalgic when BAM you are able to return to being child link again. Its win win win all the way home from there.;1029;Thus begins my reviews of all the relevant Zelda games for consoles. I say relevant because I am simply refusing to acknowledge the latest multiplier atrocity for the WiiU on moral grounds. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendos flagships which it wheels out of the closet every few years with another update from the hugely successful Ocarina of Time game for n64 in the late 90s. Since then the franchise has gotten progressively worse in a very uniform pattern I have coined: The nostalgia vortex. The phenomenon occurs when you have such a brain fryingly good time with a game as a child that you would wait untill mum goes to bed before turning it on again with the volume at 1% so you could still hear the jingly noises that made up so much of the fun. Then, as the years go by and you develop curious hair and an interest in the opposite sex that you forget about the game for a while. Eventually after being rejected by the opposite sex and the hair thing has also lost its novelty, you blow the dust out of those old cartridges and see if the old girl still works. Amazing! It does! Ands whats this? Its still LOADS of fun to play. The Vortex is not yet explained by this alone but I will continue its explanation in the second installment of these reviews.;There is a glitch where you can actually wear a pot....;4;There is a glitch where you can actually wear a pot!;Zelda Reviewathon #1;198;739
81;So in conclusion its actually quite fun but, really, after a lot of weirdness and masks, youre not left with much more than the original prequel.;Majoras mask starts with the actual link from the prequel looking for his fairy or some shit. And immediately at this point all the kids ask themselves how did he get out of Hyrule? I know every last inch of that country and there is no exit. Eventually some Gypsy mugs him and steals his Oot and turns him into a shrub (told you it was more Japanese) forcing Link to follow him to a clock town called Clock Town. The next three days break every rule of time travel pop culture but it works anyway and makes for a lot of fun with all the side quests and collectible masks. Eventually you face off with the Gypsy only to discover he was being controlled by the mask which then proceeds to transform into things and to fight him in the moon which is about to crash into earth... oh, and the moon has a face...;1030;In the first review I started explaining my Nostalgia Vortex theory. It started by explaining that as a child you have a wonderful, irreplaceable experience on, perhaps, one of your first games. Then, after 2 or three years, as you are still bright eyes and innocent on the cusp of pubehood. SEQUEL! Bam, there goes the dynamite. Nintendo knock the ball out of the park with Majoras mask. Majoras mask was a slightly darker, slightly more advanced, slightly more Japanese version of Oot. It keeps the same graphics and many of the same characters as Oot but expands the game enough and ads enough more features for it to be  worthwhile. Or does it? Remember, at this point we are still 10, 15 year old shitlings with nothing better at the time than diablo 2. Would a sequel try to pull that shit these days and we would have a dreamcast!;The moons face gives you nightmares.;4;There is a guy living in a toilet who you can give paper to in return for hearts.;Zelda reviewathon #2;198;740
82;In summary Wind Waker is a special game that doesnt really scream special in the grand scheme of things. Yes it hit the right notes and gameplay was fun, but it was also an abrupt change of tone that some gamers might be put off by.;Wind Wanker starts with Link being a humble boy on an island in a sparse archipelago populated by freaks, monsters and inefficient pirates captained by the only normal looking blonde female character who is clearly princess Zelda. After some fapping around you meet a boat who can talk, obviously, and you set off to rescue your sister and eventually Zelda. One thing leads to another and you sail all over the shop controlling the wind and finding booty. Its by far the most unique Zelda for consoles so far. One might even go as far as to place it in a separate category as it really doesnt feel very Zeldary at all. However link still has his pictobox, boomerang, green hat that serves no purpose on his grotesquely oversize head, so it feels enough like home to call it Zelda.;1033;A couple of years after Majoras Mask played the N64s swan song, the game cube burst onto the stage to wow us with something or other. As if retroactively listening to me, Nintendo went for a completely unique style or game which some loved, other feared and all sort of ignored. With its cell shaded graphics and cartoon feel. I personally loved the game and wish Link would do some more nautical stuff. The trouble with this is that now, those little shitlings who opened Oot on Christmas morning all wide eyed and innocent. Or even the ones who used their paper rout money to buy Majoras mask. They are now thinking breathing gamer teenagers who are expecting all the same endorphins that Oot gave them as children. And in an age of GTA vice city, Morrowind and Splinter Cell... its easy to see why this plucky little game didnt get the response it deserved.;filling out the map was like homework.;21;The sailing could get tedious but mostly I enjoyed it.;Zelda Reviewathon #3;198;741
83;Good game but certainly follows the vortex pattern of quality diminishing as it flies further from the OoT nest. But the fans got what they asked for, yet again, and were still not totally happy with their experience, which nearly concludes our Reviewathon with the final installment next.;As if listening to a mass consumer market making comments about cartoony graphics and swollen heads, Nintendo went full circle and made a darker, more adult version of Zelda to appeal to its aging fan base.  The game starts with Link as a farm helper on a goat ranch where he literally tosses goats into submission. The story is convoluted and includes another dimension where everything is basically the same but all black and purple and mysteriously mysterious. It also brings back the fishing feature and includes yet more monkeys. The little imp helper you get is the only sort of cutesy part left in the game and even she was turned into pornographic fan art by Zeldaphiles. The story, as mentioned, is a bit choppy and the gameplay can drag on a bit but overall its enjoyable and a well sold game of 2006, competing with Oblivion and Okami. It was made available for both the Gamecube and the Wii which may have helped its sales but also included a majority of Gamers who were not on the latest console bandwagon yet.;1036;By this time those of us trapped in the Nostalgia Vortex are still holding out a glimmer of hope that Twighlight Princess brings us our full kick of endorphins we only now enjoy through narcotics experiments at college. And in short, it doesnt. As we have previously seen, these radical changes in Zelda are both good and bad. On the one hand a game has to move on to stay relevant. On the other hand, for every goat molested in this game, it shakes the foundation of love we have built on Zelda as a child.;Tossing goats;5;Pretty environments and characters. Wolf form was awesome.;Zelda reviewathon #4;198;742
84;Overall Nintendo really blew it trying to please everyone at once, there is enjoyment to be had from the game but it doesnt engage me like the other 4 did. That concludes my time here vomiting opinion and musings, I hope I have shed light and tears. Cheerio!;Skyward Sword is a WindWakery-TwighlightPrincessy-Oot wannabee.... its vastly ambitious and linear at the same time. It starts with you on a floating island in the sky and you happen to have a bird familiar for some unexplained reason. You flap around and eventually you have to go to the surface world to rescue the Princess Zelda again, who in this instance is being played by an over-attached neurotic brat who pushes you off a cliff at one point.  After landing on the surface you are then trapped in a very linear environment where each new area is sucked for all its worth before letting you on to the next one until you are at the end where... well its the end. The sky world had a lot of potential too but it seems to just be floating flotsam and jetsam with simple collectible-type side quests.;534;The final installment to date and a long wait for gamers. From 2006s dark and adult link striking chords with many of its aged fan base, what can Nintendo do to retain them, now in their 20s and with student loans to spend! What about those others? Those whos first experience of Zelda was not on the N64 but with the Gcubes Windwaker? What about those who have never had a Zelda experience? Those kids who are only allowed a Wii because mummy and daddy like the idea of slight arm exercise over none at all. The folks over at Nintendo had to put their thinking caps on (which in Japan is just a regular cap) and come up with something that would appeal to all of them. They then promptly gave up and made Skyward Sword.;The map was so small.;5;flying was amusing.;Zelda reviewathon #5;198;743
87;Like any expansive open world high fantasy RPG its an awesome game but the flaws are mostly held to heart by console gamers who demand shiny things to be flawless. Flawless it-is-not as glitches are common as they were in the previous games. Its almost becoming a style in the Elder Scrolls series to have games that are so full of bugs that ant eaters are circling bethesda studios as we speak.;The story goes that you are a prisoner (again) who is at the mercy of the empire (again) and then suddenly a dragon comes and you escape. You are then asked if you would like to follow the rebels or the empire, which actually doesnt matter but those who choose the empire are retarded. Eventually you wind up finding out you are the chosen one (again) who must do something or other to stop the end of the world (again) even if you would just rather be stealing peoples shit and moving corpses in to amusing poses.;472;This game is more engaging than a lock on a public bathroom. Once started you have a rather generic high fantasy experience of running around figuring out whats worth stealing and whats not, finding exploits and getting the camera angle just right to look at cleavage. After a while though you might tire of the combat and fetchemall missions and then you start another character. Perhaps now you are an orc or a cat thing with a penchant for pick pocketing. Maybe you are a haggard xenaphobic nord. Either way you are starting to become a role player without even realizing it. I found myself coming up with reasons why my character stood still for a minute before entering a dungeon, or going into walk mode around a town to seem more like I lived there. Morning Captain Lonelygale! Hows the crops coming on? Seen any trolls on the road? I would say as I stole his flawless sapphires. The world is so full of caves (and Im not kidding, its like swiss cheese) that you might think the adventure never gets dull but there is only so many barrows, caves, passages and dungeons you can raid before you start asking yourself what you will do when you retire from pillage.;Glitches also allow you to walk into a boulder and fall off the ace of the earth.;6;Glitches can allow your follower to blow up an enemy with a spell and then you can shoot him off the face of the earth with an arrow.;Blackbriar mead anyone?;198;562
88;Overall the game was great. I had so much fun playing this. Certainly worth a try. Especially if youre a Pokémon fan.;This game was fantastic. The story was the same as the original. But it was way more in depth. Much better graphics. More interactive storyline. Like in the original for catching Rayquaza was just go and catch him. But this one made it a second story. Mega Evolutions are neat. I was skeptical at first but now I think its great. The elite four gets stronger when battling them a second time. Mauville City was completely redone. It looks way cooler now. With more shops to do fun little activities. Pokémon Contests are still here for course. They have been improved. Theyre much more interactive and exciting then before. And all the music was great. My favorite was the Pokémon contest lobby tune. So catchy. The graphics were great. 3D wasnt in everything. But when it was, it was nice and clear.  Secret bases are back too. Its been improved. Its a streetpass feature. Or you can use QR codes. And also assemble a team of friends. Plus you can chose which character you are instead of the game deciding for you. Also finding wild Pokémon is better and you can use the HM Fly to go anywhere.;6898;This game was incredible. Truly a masterpiece. Best remake of a game that a remake could be.;;37;-Secret bases -Pokémon contests -graphics -music -mega evolutions;Best Pokemon yet;169;6322
89;Overall this game was great. A nice fun little game to play if you have a Wii U.;This game was great. Its pretty much a bunch of puzzles to solve. But its with Captain Toad. He doesnt do much for fighting. Just using the level to your advantage. Throwing onions and falling on enemies. There is a story to it. A nice little story to along with what youre doing and why. Collecting stars at the end of each level. But in each level there is a challenge to do and three diamonds to find. And it can be challenging. The graphics are great. The music is nice and adventurous. A little guys big journey feel to it.;7337;This game was great. It was adorably fun to play with exciting little puzzles to go through.;;41;;Captain Toad is awesome;169;6471
92;Although most times I myself have played this game as a single-player, it is helpful to keep in mind that Toejam & Earl actually is designed to be a two-player game with a single-player option. It is in fact a surprisingly challenging game and (especially for children) difficult to master. Due to its slow pace it can get quite frustrating and even boring when played alone. The best way to exploit the games full potential is to invite your best friend or asking a dear sibling to spend some time with you, while taking them on an early 90s adventure which is best described as ludicrous. So, spend some time in company and have fun!;Toejam & Earl is definitely not a childrens game. There are simply too many satiric references on modern society and (primarily) late 1980s pop-culture which you simply cant understand before reaching a certain level of education. Your deadliest enemies in this game for instance are swarms of killer bees, wacky dentists, invisible bogey-men, tomato-bombing chicken, nerds and - last but not least - ice-cream vans which in a late stage of the game keep tormenting you by appearing out of nowhere. Your usual weapons are items like running trainers, sling shots and spring shoes, or more absurd items like decoy balloons or a boom-box to distract the Earthlings. These items are scattered around every map in presents, whose content has to be revealed throughout the game, as not all the items are a blessing.;8389;Toejam & Earl is a dungeon crawler from 1991 for the Sega Mega Drive (aka Genesis) console. I got the European PAL-version in summer 1992, which also was the first video game I ever owned. Back in the day I was just 7 years old and to be honest my parents got it for me rather desperately just because Sonic the Hedgehog was sold out. As a child I didnt like the games slow pace, I found it too difficult and way too frustrating. It began to grow on me slowly only when I started to catch my dad playing it. Occasionally I would join in and playing it with two players the game became much more fun and entertaining.;The only negative point is, that after a dozen of levels the game doesnt offer any real surprises anymore and gets a bit repetitive.;29;Alongside with Toejam & Earls creative and hilarious storyline, I still find the games two-player cooperative mode with interchangeable split screen/single-screen graphics quite impressive and groundbreaking for its time. The controls are very intuitive and easy to understand. The soundtrack may not be everybodys taste, but it suits the games atmosphere.;The virtual Godfathers of Funk;900;6666
93;If you could need a good laugh, like Trash-Movies and think bugs can be fun then this game might be good for you. If you additionally dont need a story or plot then you should definitly try it out. Against many believes that Goat Simulator destroys the Industry (*cough* EA employees *cough*) I think a Game from a company like Coffee Stain Studios which brought us several other great games (Sanctum Series) with such huge Support from the Company and Community is definitly worth a try. Content are worth at least 8+ hour + Steamwork.  Havent had that much fun with a game for a long time and for that little money.;I personally love the Game for several reasons. First it made me laugh for hours, you pick it up have some fun and let it be when you arent in mood. You dont play it for weeks/months and then again, you start playing and laugh. It has entertained me more than many current AAA-Titles. And thats what I want, I play games for entertainment and fun. In a more and more serious Industry where Graphics are getting more Importance than Gameplay and Fun this is a shining example with what simple Ideas you can create a hit. I have 10+ hours in this Game and laughed about 8+ hours of that. But Coffee Stain Studios didnt just put out the Game, they gave a lot back to the Community. Adding in Patch 1.1 a second, as big as the first, map + Local Coop and in Patch 1.2 a lot more stuff they keep the fun in the game for free. A gift for the Support, something we havent seen from big Publishers in the last years. Even if you find everything in the game (what seems impossible to me without help) there is a huge community working on bringing new Content for the Game by Steam Workshop.;5335;So this is my first review here on IGDB and I want to dedicate it to Goat Simulator for several reasons. For first I do like this game because it is broken, full of Bugs etc. Whos  expecting more will be disappointed. Even the official statement of Coffee Stain Studios says so: Goat Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game. It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.  There are several reasons for that. For first Goat Simulator was an idea Coffee Stain Studio hat at a Gamejam session for trying out new Stuff on the Unreal Engine. For fun they released some Gameplay on Youtube. The Video went viral, got Millions of Views in a few days, and the demand for a real Release grew. Coffee Stain Studios then decided to make it a real release and in 3 Months they developed and released the game.;No Story (but not necessary for this Game) Graphics could be better Game might Crash/reset without reason;6;You can Play a Goat Tons of laughs Casually playable Lots of Content for 10$/€ (of Cheaper on Sale) You can be a Goat You can be other types of Goats Steam Workshop Big Community Local Coop Hilarious Easter Eggs You can not just be a Goat but Goat Queen, Angel Goat, Demon Goat etc. Did i mention you can be a microwave;Fun because broken.;338;6608
94;But overall, its a fantastic game. Long story line to complete and lots of other collectables and tombs to find. Certainly worth playing if you havent already.;This game is awesome. The story is fantastic. Very intense and action packed. Its like watching a movie. The story is that great. Lara Croft makes Indiana Jones look weak. The pain she endures and the nonsense she goes through is crazy.  The gameplay was nice. No annoying controlling mishaps. And it flowed nicely. The graphics were fantastic. And I was on 360. I can only imagine for next gen consoles. And the music was good. It really helps. When the music starts playing then enemies are aware of your location. Which was something that all games seem to do. Once they know youre in the area they all flood around and instantly know where to shoot.;1164;This game is awesome. Totally worth playing at some point. Very fun.;;12;-Great story -No controller mishaps;Great!;169;728
95;Overall, this game wasnt that great. I wasnt expecting it to be great. It was exactly what I expected. If you want to kill an hour and a half you could give it a try.;This game was lame. There was a plot. You inherit a Theater from your aunt which you decide to turn into a Café. Thats the whole game. It took an hour and a half to complete. Throughout the walking around you have to run back and forth doing everything for everybody in the game. Which is stupid. And some of the tasks are off the wall random. Like I have to print these papers. In the mean time take pics of butterflies in the park. Why am I taking pictures of butterflies? That has nothing to do with the story. This stuff happens often in this game. The tasks usually consist of mini game challenges to complete. Which are really easy. The best one is the memory test. Like the simon says button game. That was the best part about the game. Plus you collected butterflies, flowers, and berries for nothing. I never found out what they do. Just to do something extra. Also you can change your skin color, hair color and clothes whenever you want. Mix and match. The biggest thing that bothered me were the orders or objectives that needed to be done. They were never very specific. Finish decorating Finish decorating what? The Café? My house? and with what.  The graphics were typical early GBA graphics. With more girly colors. The soundtrack was a soundtrack. It had one tune it played the entire game. The only change was when a mini game started. Then that mini games tune would play.;6399;Pretty lame game. I know its probably targeted for younger girls, but I played it anyway. Dont judge. I like to play all games.;-Bad instructions -lame;24;-Memory game;Why did I bother?;169;6928
96;This game, I think-was very underutilized. And, I believe the reason for this was because it was ahead of its time. Much like Dreamcast, it introduced a number of features that have become a staple in modern gaming-yet was under appreciated when it was released. I still go back to this game and play it every now and again, despite the dated graphics-it was extremely well-crafted, and a brilliant retro game.;The game established a lot of the gameplay that has become famous in the Civilizations games. It had limited troop movement, turn based engagement, and civilization-building themes. Yet, it was not as complicated as Civilizations-and I think this is one of the things that made it great. There were many different things that you could do in the game, and you could choose whether or not you wanted to. Many of the things, such as settlement development and diplomacy could be set on automatic. Surprisingly, the ai was excellent for this, and I often indulged in this to focus on things that interested me more. The turn-based system worked perfectly for the game, since it reflected well the time period that it was portraying. I thought it was particularly brilliant how one could play as the natives. As is accurate for the time-it was extremely difficult to win with the natives. However, it was possible-essentially, the natives could only be levelled up to 2 (as opposed to 4). However, they could expand and build troops waaay faster than the other nations. This meant that, if you were quick, you could destroy the other nations before they gained a foothold on the land.  Beyond the above gameplay, the turn-based system worked so effectively because it allowed you to micromanage to your hearts delight. I remember my brothers and I would play this game, and quite often one person would take 1/2 hour or more on a turn. The other two players would be off doing completely different things-so games could last for quite a while. Conveniently-you did not have to finish a game in one sitting, and could save a game for a later date. It was risk for the computer, but in a highly sophisticated way, and with an accurate portrayal of an exciting time-period.;2616;I played this game quite a lot when I was in grade 6-12 with my two older brothers. Looking back, it amazes me how long we all maintained our interest in this game-it was ahead of its time with the complexity of the strategy required, as well as the detail included.;The multi-player cannot be done online-otherwise this game would be as famous as Age of Empires.;13;Everything!;Ahead of its time!;808;6948
97;I realize that non of that makes much sense. But it really isnt a good game. Dont waste your time.;It was so bad. I love playing weird out there games. And this one looked bad. However, I did enjoy Mighty Bean toys. But this was awful. Just the worst. Its a puzzle game. So there is not a story. So I get to match Mighty Beanz together. Its in a square and Mighty Bean halves are all over. So the objective is to match the correct head to the correct body. Which I dont know what pieces go where. It shows a corner image of the bean youre hovering on. It shows the full body so you know what to look for. But its incredibly boring. And not worth the challenge. Because they throw in several pieces at a time with no connectors. The graphics are bad. The sound was sound. The game worked. I guess the more puzzles you get through, the more Mighty Beanz you collect.;6510;This was so bad. Not in the fun way either.;;24;;Awful;169;7051
98;I know none of that made sense. But it really is a terrible game. Dont waste your time.;It was so bad. I love playing weird out there games. And this one looked bad.

99;This game was surprisingly fun to play , you get to do pretty much what you want. From sex with the main character (which can be avoided if you want to) to killing few of the guys that might piss you off. Its my absolute favorite RPG for now and it will keep its place for a long time probably (cause witcher 3 is coming soon).  Its a 94/100 for me.;Storyline  The story revolves around Geralt of Rivia which has amnesia and gets through all sorts of problems through the game to find the Kingslayer that murdered King Foltest and ran off right after leaving the blame on Geralt. Pieces of the story keep unfolding throughout the game and mostly the conversations are nice to listen to. The story has a twist where you can chose which side you want to join and you can change every bit of conversation between Geralt and other characters with the phrases youre presented with. The only downside would be that Geralt doesnt always say the thing that you chose , but he changes the response a little. You are also presented with 2 endings so if you really like the game you can play it twice without worries cause you have some more content if you play again and chose a different path.   Controls   The controls are pretty good once you accommodate with them. Though there are problems sometimes when you try to pick up loot because you have no idea where your mouse is and sometimes you cant pick up some stuff , but thats not a huge problem , you wont be missing too much.  The character moves pretty smooth and you can do some nice combos , not too hard to do but they look pretty bad-ass. They might tend to look repetitive after a while. ( I played the game 3 times from the beginning to the end)  Audio   The audio in this game is pretty relaxing. It gets you immersed in the game and it fits the situation youre in pretty well. The dialogues are worth listening to as the voice actors are really good , but some dialogues are pretty pointless and do not affect your gameplay at all. Theyre there just in case you wanna know some more.  Graphics   This game is about 4 years old now. And id have to say there arent many games out there that are so graphically astonishing. We still have Crysis 3 and Battlefield 4 , Arma 3 and so on which are amazing. But witcher 3 aint too far either. The surrounding graphics are really good , the only thing thats not so good is the grass which you can fix with a mod that you can get for free. The lights are bright and colorful which makes the game stunning. There are some graphical glitches from place to place but they arent that annoying (one being an invisible pair of boots , your boots wont display neither your feet , but thats with only one certain pair of boots you get on insane mode).  Also in case youre disappointed with the graphics in the end , dont worry , Witcher 3 is arriving and youll get even better graphics and an open world.;478;Hello , my name is Nick and im here to introduce you to the world of The Witcher. I first started to play this game 2 years ago on my crap PC and it worked OK for few runs , but the graphics card eventually couldnt keep up anymore and i was really sad. I wanted to play it so much so i waited and last year I finally managed to play the game 60 fps maxed out.  The game is absolutely one of the best RPGs out there. If youll stick to this review I will also explain why.;I didnt like the fact that it wasnt open world. First time I did the main mission and then i got moved to chapter 2 so i missed most side quests from chapter 1.  Your inventory has 250 capacity and it gets full pretty  fast , not to mention you walk slower when your inventory is full. If you dont pay attention and youre far away from a Merchant or Storage , youre doomed. If you play the game twice it doesnt give you the option to skip the Prologue if you want to. I didnt find the need to play the prologue so many times as it didnt change anything from chapter 1 to chapter 3.  If you just started playing the game , sometimes you get lost because you dont know how exactly to get to the place that you need to get to for some missions.  At a mission you lose your weapon and you dont get it back.  The game can be hard even on the easiest difficulty for some people. The game has high graphic standards so not every PC can run it at its max capacity. If you decide to ignore the side quests and go through the main only , the game can be pretty short . As the speed run is 2 hours and 18 minutes on hard. A beginner on easy would take around 10 hours to complete without side quests.  Invisible walls that wont let you pass even though its obvious you can pass through that gap.  You get awesome armor and weapons , but in chapter 3 where you have about 40 minutes left of gameplay.;6;The combat is nice and not too easy.  You have spells that help you in all sorts of situations , each doing something for a different cause.  You can play dice poker, arm wrestle , fist fight and sword fight , and all of this for money and Dice Poker is not a certain win like the other 3. You chose what to do in certain situations. You can kill mobs , meditate for a day till they respawn and kill them again for fun. Meditation takes 2 seconds. You can have a drink in certain situations and youll feel dizzy after.  If youre willing to explore everything and do all the possible quests youre going on a nice and decently long story (around 40-50 hours). You can take a haircut and make a tattoo.  You sometimes do amazing finishers.  And youre a bad-ass mage swordsman.;Witcher 2 - Assassins of Kings Review by Leinchetzu;986;7031
1456;I am genuinely disappointed in this game. Hopefully the success games in the series do not disappoint me to this extent. The first AC was brilliant-it was new, innovative, and exciting. This does not follow in the same way.;I love story-lines. That is the primary reason why i play games is for the story-I am able to directly interact with a movie in a way. Unfortunately, this game is so very obsessed with extending the play-time that the story is often interrupted with klunky and incredibly frustrating extended gameplay of repetitive frustration. The controls mean that silly glitches happen quite frequently, which means that you are suddenly needing to completely restart your mission. At one point in the game, you are told to kill 9 lieutenants in order to help start an uprising. Five I could understand-even six, but nine?! And each one has a frustrating way to get at the person-although all are essentially the same. At this point in the game, the story has dragged on so long that you (or at least I) was desperate to finally get to the ending, and I found standing in my way an incredibly tedious line of trial-and error. Luck should not be a significant factor in a game such as this, yet it truly is. This game is ridiculously long-needlessly long.  The storyline needed to be much more succinct, and the intentional extension of gameplay only served to cause a great deal of frustration.  Update: just discovered I have to go back and treck around the cities to collect all the codex pages before I can advance-would have been nice if I would have known this while I was doing the storyline, instead of having to go back!;127;I want to enjoy this game, and there are parts of the story that I love. The audio is great, as are the graphics. The concept has so much potential-but they went to fast with this game, trying new things without updating the controls to keep pace. This may be a pc problem specifically, but I dont believe I have ever been so frustrated with a game.;Much of this may be based on my experience with the game on pc, but the controls are beyond frustrating at times, and the game drags on needlessly.;6;Points in the story-line are great, there are some truly exciting sections, and it is always fun flying through the air.;So very frustrating!;808;6951
1457;This game was masterfully crafted, and is probably one of the most underrated games I have ever played. I wish more people would discover it, and I would love to see a revival of the series utilizing modern graphics engines, but remaining faithful to the original style of game-play.;The two Magic Carpet games are delightful in their fresh gameplay and totally unique win-factors. The controls were excellent, especially considering the age of the game-whisking around the world on the magic carpet was truly delightful, and the concept of collecting mana and battling for control of it with other wizards had such an ingenious feel that it was an absolute delight to play the game. I admit, I remember very little about the story-I simply remember the joy of discovering new abilities, finding new places, and completing levels. Choosing the perfect place for your castle was always a huge part of the strategy, and exploration was a massive focal-point. One other thing that I remember in particular is the audio-many of the sound effects were so very unique and enchanting that still, when I hear similar sounds in games and movies, I find myself experiencing a flood of nostalgia for my childhood.;780;I still have no idea how my brothers and I even attained this game-it seemed to have simply appeared on our computer one day. My suspicion is that we installed it as part of a pack with other games that we were more interested in, and then simply discovered it later. Regardless, it ended up becoming my first addiction in the world of gaming.;The storyline was perhaps less-than-memorable, and the game could become repetitive at times.;13;The audio was more than enticing, the controls were easy yet complex and intricate, and the style of game-play is totally unique and truly brilliant.;Hidden Gem;808;10971
1458;Do not buy.;The game is 2% game, 98% christian propaganda. The puzzles you face are repetitive and boring, the most common puzzle is Here are three phrases of scripture, put them in order to build a quote from the bible.  Most other puzzles are also blatant propaganda. The dialogue is bland, the levels are very simple and the story is simply bad.;8181;Thought I was in for a few hours of platform puzzling;Everything else;6;It was short;Do not buy;415;11084
1459;TL DR - A very good gameplay and beautiful game that I would recommend anyone who likes a good open world game.;So first of all, this game is extremely gorgeous. A very well made world with beautiful graphics. A very well crafted world. The story line is very good aswell, with a new exciting story that challenges your ethical choices. I really enjoyed the game all over, but found at some points that the side objectives hadnt gotten much attention since Far Cry 3, which made it feel a little like the same stuff. I would however recommend this game to anyone who finds the Open World/FPS combo interesting, and pretty much everyone who likes a well made game that takes ~20 hours to finish. The different endings to the game is both good and bad in my opinion. But I suppose you will have to figure that out by yourself. I will however give you a hint to an easter egg in the game  when you get control of your character and you are told to stay put at the table, remain seated for 15 minutes. This will trigger and additional ending theyve implemented. Now go try it out!;6801;Im a casual gamer who likes to play whatever games I find interesting. Ive played Far Cry 4 very recently and wanted to share my opinion with you.;1 of the endings Some side objectives;6;Graphics Gameplay Storyline;Beautiful scenery and a good storyline.;1032;11379
1460;Is the game fun? It surely is. Is it more to say? Yes, but Im not a very good writer. The game is too short, and for some people, too easy to beat. If you like puzzles, youll definitely like Portal. Its a must play.;Portal can be finished in two hours if youre good at puzzles, theyre not hard. When you start, youre introduced to GLaDoS. Shes the one whos going to guide you. The game eliminates the stress and the frustration by inserting funny jokes and a LOT of easter eggs. It also has the best easter eggs Ive ever seen, and Portal 2 was leaked in an easter egg. The games full of I want more and Kill me please moments. So...why are we being tested? Why is GLaDoS monitoring me and not a person? Those questions have no answer.  Portal is a new type of game. Instead of giving you an ordinary weapon, it gives you a portal gun which shoots portals. You can shoot two portals, each type being binded on a mouse button, and once both of them are shot, a link is created between them and you can walk through them. Theyre pretty much...portals. They teleport you from a portal to another. The fun about the game is that not also you have portals, but you have objects, like companion cubes, which you have to control by moving them through portals.;71;For the past years, Ive been a gamer. But Im always returning to Portal. Once in a while, I like replaying it, but why? Well, for me, its like a drug. The story combines a mystery with a futuristic lab and you ask yourself: How did the world get to test those things? Whos monitoring me?. Well, that creates a mystery.;too short can get boring;6;innovative the cake is a lie challenging;[Spoilers]Portal - A drug, not a puzzle;896;11465
1461;Overall, the second sort of play through is still fun. Pretty much trying all the options you didnt do the last play through.;The game is just like Alpha Sapphire. And thats the way it should be. Thats how Pokémon dominates the market. But these are remakes of the originals. And even then I played Sapphire first and slacked on Ruby. I dont know why. I just prefer fighting Team Agua and getting Kyogre than fighting Team Magma and getting Groudon. Kyogre was always more interesting. The story is still fantastic. I enjoyed it the first time. The music works great with the story and the mood its trying to show. Graphics are great. 3D is nice. Spoiler: Latios in Ruby. Latias in Sapphire. And I was skeptic about mega evolutions. But now I understand them. It was an awesome idea. Really enjoyed the game.;6897;Since I played Alpha Sapphire first this is more of a review as a second play through.

And its a lot of fun to play with your friends in splitscreen-mode (or online).;If you want a good looking game with partyfeatures and some of the best racingtracks to this date, then Mario Kart 8 is the game for you. There is almost nothing to negative about the game, except some details Nintendo should take care of. Thanks to the possibillity of downloading ad-ons via eShop we can now enjoy a Mario Kart game longer!   There is one BIG downside thou, and thats the battlearenas, there is no one!

1463;I would only recommend this game to people who want to find out what happens in the Red Faction-universe.;When Volition released the first Red Faction-game back in 2001, it created quite a stir because of the Geo-Mod Engine. Suddenly gamers could mould the game environment with rockets and grenades  for example, shoot holes in walls and walk through those holes  things we dont think about these days.  Released only one year after the first game, Red Faction II (2002), is surprisingly bad in almost every category. Most obvious is the edgy graphics and the somewhat short campaign. The story is as you can imagine, quite bad and you never really get to know the characters. I dont know who wrote the script, but lines like:  Hey Alias, lets get wet ... - is pretty dumb coming from a female character in a sub.  I had no trouble at all playing this PC-version on my Windows 8 OS. Everything worked very well.

1465;If you are looking for a nice looking shooter to get you through the day, you need to play Hard Reset.;Warsaw based studio Flying Wild Hog, are no strangers to FPS-games, rather, they are connoisseurs of the genre who know how gamer hearts work. In Hard Reset, they have managed to combine the spirit and feel of the old school shooter with amazing graphics, and it is a wild ride, if not for a lifetime, then for at least 10 - 15 hours if you are an acheivement hunter.  In the extended version of the game, you get the DLC Exile for free, which is quite generous in these times. Previous Hard Reset-owners can also download the DLC for free, which keeps the action going for at least two more hours.  Storywise, there is nothing new here, but there doesnt have to, which is something I really liked about the game. You go from one scene to another, knowing exactly what you should do, just like in the old days  so be prepared to use your tiggerfinger alot.;532;Gamer for over thirty years, with a certain affection for FPS-games.;- Hard to switch weapons fast sometimes - Voice acting is OK - You cant run and jump at the same time;6;+ Sharp and crisp visuals + Fairly lenghty campaign + Nice audio;Fun & electricity;1138;11761
1467;Overall, if youre going to buy this game, its like buying an empty house. Yeah sure it has power, a roof over your head and running water - but you have to fill out the home with the wonderful furniture that is FSX add-ons and expansion packs.;Flight Simulator X offers a wide range of scenarios, destinations and aircraft to fly - with very accurate flying principles. An example of this is the use of ILS, VOR/DME and GPS navigation systems in IFR flights. The graphics for something released in 2006 are not half bad - but the software does not utilize RAM very well at all so even with a good system, can still be very demanding to run  but the audio and atmospherics of the game make up for this with brilliant weather captured from real world weather stations - and endless opportunities with the multi-player option. However, the content of the game is quite limited and you will be bored of it after a month or so, so that is where the community comes in. FSX has one of the best communities out there, that offer breathtaking new add-ons that push the realism and graphical capabilities to the max. Products such as the PMDG 737 NGX are the icing on the cake for this game, and it would be nothing without these enhancements.;301;I have been using this software for over 6 years and have fallen completely in love with it. I refer to it as software and not a game because it is a tool for learning and simulation as opposed to an arcade model game.;- Extremely limited content  youll need to buy add-ons for this which can make the game worth over £1000 by the time youre done.;6;- Excellent simulation platform. - Advanced controls. - Multi-player capabilities (LAN/Server based with the Steam Edition) - Tutorials from a real world pilot. - Real-world weather simulation.;A great base platform.;1154;11927
1468;Alien: Isolation is a recipe of walking, pulling levers, and uneventful filler that was very sloppily put together. It was a game I had to force myself to play. It’s too slow paced (God save you when you have to climb a ladder), and my first Alien encounter (there weren’t many after that), didn’t happen until about two-and-a-half hours in and it wasn’t even surprising. At times it had its moments. The hacking systems were unique, but drawn out. The little bit of soundtrack is good, but pretty much non-existent. And the environment is executed in a way to where you really do almost feel isolated, except, the level design sucks. If I had to give this game a score, I’d give it a 5 for trying.;Boast: The Creative Assembly (Total War, Stormrise), wanted to create an adapting and learning Alien, one with an advanced AI so that you couldn’t use the same tactic on it twice and would hunt you down by smell, sound, and sight. And it would be totally awesome… if the AI was good. I’m gonna hit you with something real quick. You die a lot in this game, and the save points aren’t too forgiving, which I think is what the devs were going for. But, when you reload, you have to go through some unecessary shit to actually get to the ‘gameplay’ section of where you last died. And the enemies (androids, other humans and the Alien), can find you anywhere. There was no point in hiding, holding your breath, leaning away, or being all the way across the room shrouded in smoke. All of that meant nothing. You could argue either way that it  helped the game, or hurt it. In all actuality though, it was a broken mechanic. It got to the point where it was frustrating, and when you passed the alien, it wasn’t satisfying.   EyeCandy: I launched the game and it was running pretty choppy. Not the cinematics, those looked great. They looked really good. It’s probably one of the highest praises I’d give the game, especially the lighting and the particles. I’m talking about when I was able to first walk around. I said, “What the?”, went to the video menu, and EVERY setting was jacked up to Ultra. I don’t have a bad rig, but holy hell, that was ridiculous. So then I put everything as low as it could go, or off, (out of spite), and it looked very damn well close to the max settings. Though, I should mention that the game still ran slow and laggy. Strike one. Regardless though, it looked surprisingly well. The artwork and texturing are great and it covers up the mediocrity in the modeling. But that just comes from them having a budget. The way every environment was illustrated really did set the tone and the mood for the game. It was all run-down, everything was broken, the environment was uncomfortable and I think that’s what the developers were trying to do. I loved it. Also, it all looked retro and 70’s-ish so that was kind of badass. The characters are pretty skimped out on though, except the Alien. All of the polys and budget went straight to the Alien. It looks phenomenal. Other than that, Isolation looks like a half-upgrade from a Valve game.  Sound: There’s multiple settings in the game for your preferred audio experience. The two I played with were Full Dynamic Range and simply, Headphones. So, tell me why there was a nil difference between the two. The sound design and spacial recognition were absolutely atrocious. The redundancy of sounds will confuse you into thinking there’s a usable machine to your left, but it’s not. It’s actually upstairs, two rooms away, and it’s a completely different object. The dialogue, to change subjects, is not written well. I was going through a vent and my partner asked a personal question. Cool, character divulsion and story expansion. But that was it. He just asked me a question and Ripley didn’t answer, so we kept on crawling. But maybe that was a good thing, because the main character (oh God the main character), is so bad at voice acting it’s not even funny. Worse than Kristen Stewart. Enough said. It doesn’t make any sense though, because the supporting cast does a good, industry standard, job. It was very disappointing to experience something like that. There’s nothing to say about the soundtrack, it’s all ambiance. Except, I will say that the use of buildup was pretty cool. You hear the dissonant strings rise in volume and a rapid drum that simulates a fast heartbeat, it was pretty cool. Sound wise though, that’s the only thing that stood out.  Gameplay: This one might be a doozy. First off, this game has the slowest beginning in the history of slow beginnings I have ever played. Part of the problem is that the game has no sense of direction. A good game directs you without letting you know you’re being directed. This one makes it obvious (the use of certain lights), but then all of a sudden stops and you have to backtrack to where you were and go somewhere you didn’t know you could access because of bad design and a bad explanation of features that are in the game. I don’t expect a game to hold my hand, but at least tell me basic mapping controls. It doesn’t tell you there’s a run button until maybe an hour in, so all the backtracking and ‘exploring’ I’m doing is all walking and the running doesn’t move you any faster. I’m talking Slenderman speed here, slow as hell.  Also, the game has bad programming. I went into a room, activated a generator, and then nothing happened (even though that was my objective). So, I went out back into the bigger room and spent a good 12 minutes WALKING around, looking like a dumbass because I’m going up to walls and broken wires crouching (which I also had to figure out), and perusing them but had no luck. I went back into the smaller room to a computer terminal (that I’ve already accessed before), go through all the messages again, and exited out because there was nothing new. And then the power came back on! So I guess I was supposed to read the computer first and then turn on the generator? Bugs happen, I get it. So then a little later I’m at this sneaking part, and I die. I say eff the pre-mission dialogue, do my objective, and go back to the guy. He then continues the pre-mission dialogue and it glitched so I had to reload my save. Bugs happen, I get it. After that episode, we crawl into a vent and my character snapped onto my leader’s back and my character was lodged inside the top of the vent and I had to reload again. Okay, strike two. We came to another sneak section and I literally turned around and bumped into the enemy. I backed up, the music started going, but then nothing happened so we went ahead. My partner caught up, and then HE said, “Follow me!” and did not go anywhere. Let me repeat that, HE DID NOT MOVE. I walked around him, his eyes fixed on me, and then I went ahead and he was following me! What!? I don’t know where to go! There was no indicator telling me where to go. Strike three, I’m done. TL DR: The gameplay sucks.;4754;Finally, a survival-horror Alien game. That’s how it should be.

1469;Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a game for the fans. Not much has changed, no risks were taken, and there isn’t anything in the game that makes it original. The moonstone currency is your Eridium, and you meet the same ‘type’ of characters from the other games, just in different skins. I’m honestly a little disappointed in 2K Australia  because I know they have the skill and creativity that could’ve made this game much more and unlocked a potential that I know it has. More than likely the aimed demographic was for the fans of the series and that’s the only people I would recommend it too.  Reason: One word to describe the Borderlands series would be vapid. The Pre-Sequel is good. Easy to play, and a hilarious experience. All it is though is more Borderlands. It’s a money-maker, an over-glorified DLC.;Boast: This is a game that’s more than just an expansion to the first or second.  More guns, more wacky characters, more Borderlands. Hell of a lot of loot, and a hell of a lot of fun!  Narrative: Borderlands comes from a story telling perspective. Athena, who has been captured, is explaining to a group of misfits why you were vault hunting. And that’s as much as I’ll go into the story. While there’s nothing really ‘big’ that happens in Borderlands, where they excel is the execution in their comedy. You meet all sorts of quirky people  along the way and Dameon Clarke (Handsome Jack), once again, delivers some of the most hilarious dialogue in any video game. I  actually found him to be the highlight of the game because, in this character, I believe he’s up there with Michael Mondo (Vaas Montenegro).  Eyecandy: The visuals look exactly like Borderlands 2. Which isn’t a bad thing, but isn’t a good thing either. It didn’t even seem like there was any upgrade to the textures, or the engine, and the only change in artwork came from the characters you would eventually run into in Borderlands 2. The HeadsUpDisplay is a copy/paste and there was nothing impressive about the particle effects. I’m a little disappointed that at least here they didn’t apply their professional skill or creativity to make this installment at least visually stand out from the other two. But it’s whatever I guess…  SoundDesign: The sound engineering was done very nicely. There’s no preset mixes in the options menu, so, if you’re using headphones or running through a home theatre system, you’re out of luck there. All you have to work with is your basic mix of voice, SFX, etc. Never did the sound of action ever become over bearing though. Nor did the background ambiance become a ‘blah’ when there was a lot going on. The music is pretty much all digital-techno-eighties kind of synths for mostly everything. It was produced very nicely and it cut through very smartly from all of the sound filler that was going on. As far as the soundtrack itself, I didn’t like it. I’m not big on the eighties synthesizer sound and it kind of annoyed me. To somewhat give it a perspective, if you liked Blood Dragon’s soundtrack, you’ll like this one.  Gameplay: Now, obviously, you got your four characters to choose from. Skip down to the next paragraph if you don’t care about the characters -There’s Athena, The Gladiator, whose Kinetic Aspis is a shield that can absorb incoming damage and be thrown to inflict damage (cough…CaptainAmerica, cough). Her skills primarily revolve around defense, healing, and melee. -Next is Wilhelm, The Enforcer. He’s a cyborg that summons two flying robots named Wolf and Saint that will attack enemies, and defend you at the same time. -After that is Nisha, The Lawbringer. Her special skill is called “Showdown.” It makes you act like a Call of Duty aim bot and you’ll automatically snap to the heads of your foes getting critical hits out the ass. -And last there’s Claptrap, The Fragtrap. His ability runs a program called “VaultHunter.exe” which will give him different abilities “that asseses your current situation” and gives you the best ability. Basically it’s a random mix of skills from the other games, i.e. Gunzerker and Mechromancer.  The formula is still the same here. If it moves, you shoot it, and you collect loot along the way. I ended up going with Nisha. She seemed like the closest pick to Salvador, because in all honesty there is not much strategy to this game. At its core it’s an FPS. Each class has their customizations, and there’s a little uniqueness from SOME of the skills  but, they always just end up being increased gun damage, reload speed, etc., until you become invincible using your special skill. The guns are the same from Borderlands 2. There’s only one new addition, which is laser. And that’s self explanatory. The biggest twist is the need for O2 or “Oz” because you’re fighting on the moon’s surface. So as you’re traveling and fighting outdoors, enemies will drop canisters and the surface has these air crater pocket-thingies so you can refill and not suffocate. It’s an added feature to the game but it never becomes a problem because you’ll collect it automatically from the enemies you kill and there’s always somewhere indoors to run into close by. Other than that, there is nothing else.;6032;Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel came in hot from 2K Australia (Bioshock series). It takes place after the first game, and before the second, hence the name, Pre-Sequel. It mainly focuses on Handsome Jack and his rise to power through Hyperion that leads into Borderlands 2.;Lack of Creativity Vapidness;6;Gameplay formula Sound Design;Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Written Review;1370;13250
1470;Notice how I didnt mention the story? Theres nothing to mention. Its predictable and full of cliches. At times it gets interesting but there was only two WOW moments for me, and even then they were during cinematics.This game is literally a polished Dead Island.;EyeCandy: The visuals in the game are good. Animations are smooth and the camera feels well and natural. It never went out of whack for me. Its mainly based in a poor slum area and I believe Techland nailed it in the head (pun intended) with the environment. The rundown city has everything. Sewers, highways, caves, tall buildings, fishing ports, everything. They did a damned good job. Not to even mention the texturing and the gore. When you smash a zombies head you see pieces of its skull scattered and brain matter gushing. You can cut off arms and legs and even break their bones to stun them. When you shoot them, you see the hug gaping hole and all of their insides, it is phenomenal. AND all of the infected look disgusting (which is a good thing) and all of the people are diverse which makes the whole thing believable. If something like this were to happen, this is how it would look. Nothing is out of place. You will catch a bug or two, but theyre not frequent and theyre laughable. Overall, it looks damned good.  SoundDesign: I would have to say what stood out to me the most was the main characters voice. Roger Craig Smith is mostly known (if you didnt know) for being Ezio in Assassins Creed. He sounds good, and gave the best emotional performance out of the rest of the cast. Theres few times where Dying Light actually has music. Its mostly your basic ambience with screams and other random noises. It sounded good until I figured out its actually part of the soundtrack and the sound wasnt based on my location but it was just a repeating track pretty much. All of the thuds and cracks and booms sound good. You can hear the feeling of your character vaulting and falling and punching. So in that aspect it was fine. But other than that, theres not much else.  Gameplay: Dying light plays like a Mirrors Edge (Which I f*****g loved!) x Dead Island. Its all about the free running, parkour, and collecting loot by day, so you can survive the night because  night is when the special infected come out of hiding, the zombies are stronger, and all of your points double. It. Is. HARD. There have been plenty of times where I had to run to the nearest safe house and sleep the night away. It aint no joke. But at least the free-running mechanic is simple. There is a tiny learning curve to it, but once you get it, its butter. So basically its easy to do, but challenging to master. And since this game is a zombie game it tends to favor melee weapons. Theres all sorts of them too. Everything from pipes and hammers, to swords and concrete chunks on metal rebar. The variety of weapons are fantastic. But then it goes even deeper with the customization of not only the weapons with their crafting, upgrade, and blueprint system and durability/strength stats, but with also your main character. As you fight, kill, and scavenge all game long you earn points to level up. Within their upgrade system you can learn new moves, gain more health, become more efficient at parkour, its all there, and its pretty fair to. When you play online you can easily tell apart the low levels from the high levels. Speaking of which...  Online Gameplay: Dying Light has a competitive multiplayer, and as well as a cooperative mode. And its all seamless. If you join someone elses game you keep all of your loot and experience points and can continue where you left off in your own game and vice versa to other players that join you. The game will also tell you if youre ahead in the main story or behind when you join another game, kinda cool. I didnt want to write this game until I played a full four player coop and versus. And it was fun. I got all my buddies in and were running around, jumping, rolling, fighting off hordes, competing in loot and race events, you name it. This is easily where this game shines. And when night came the special infected jumped in (another player) and we had to destroy these nests while they had to protect them. If you dont work as a team you will lose. Plain and simple.;3042;Dying Light is an open-world sandbox where you run and jump and kill as many zombies as humanly (or undeadly) as possible. Its developed by Techland who is most notorious for their last zombie game Dead Island. Now me personally, I wasnt at all excited for this game. Played Dead Island, it was broken and ALRIGHT and after about 9 hours into the game, it corrupted my save file. After that I was completely Anti-Techland. But, with the whole next-gen thing going on, a lot of my buddies were getting it and I had few other games to play so I picked it up anyway.;Lack of story A little buggy;49;Visuals Sound Design Roger Craig Smith Seamless Online;Dying Light Written Review;1370;13477
1471;Basically, Ubisoft tried to find a different way to say the same thing. This game just wasnt thought all the way out and its basic presentation pales to how everything unfolded in Far Cry 3. Its almost like they tried too hard to do the same thing and because of that it ended up being worse.  Overall, the game wasnt deep enough and the only things youll remember from it was Shangri-La and when Pagan showed up. A good play, and a nice add to your game collection. I dont regret my buy if that means anything to you.  Reason: Obviously we all expect this game to either live up to its predecessor or reach beyond it and I honestly feel like Ubisoft didnt achieve that in any way. It was mainly the lack of main and backstory. A lot of the time you dont know why youre doing something and its because of the lack of context. To sum it up, this game is more of a transition than an evolution. But dont let that deter you, its not a bad game, it really isnt. Im going to keep playing it, but side by side, Far Cry 3 is still better.;Boast: Dive into Kyrat. A place of danger, mythology, and mystery. A place thats never boring and every second is a story.  Narrative: The story takes place in Kyrat, a fictitious country in the Himalayans. You play as Ajay (Ah-jay), who is coming back to this country to spread his mothers ashes upon her birthplace but while there you get thrown into a civil war between the Natives, and a dictator named Pagan Min (Troy Baker) who, for an unknown reason, has an odd attraction toward you. The storys pacing is very quick. Playing it, you can tell that Ubisoft already expected you played the third and everything is a little too rushed and most aspects seem like after thoughts and slapped into your face at random. Theres very little explanation as to why things happen and virtually almost no backstory.  Eyecandy: Far Cry 4 is big. The foliage is beautiful and lush, the textures are clean and detailed, and the particles are full and believable. As far as the Next-Gen look goes, I would say it could actually look just a tad bit better but that has to do with the engine, not the game. Animations are smooth, although straight ripped from the last game, and the framerate never dropped which was good. I did encounter a few bugs, but nothing game breaking, just funny ones.  SoundDesign: The sounds of Kyrat arent anything special, theyre industry standard. The weapons have a nice variety, the 3D space is accurate, and the sound effects are good. The soundtrack isnt anything of a hitter either. It has some cool tracks that stand out, but most of the time it doesnt catch or amplify the mood as well as the third one did. Not bad, but not great. And the voice acting is too try hard. In all honesty the main character and antagonist were the best in the game.  Gameplay: The game plays exactly like Far Cry 3. And I honestly mean EXACTLY like Far Cry 3. It seemed like they didnt even update their scripting or touch the core of the game. For instance, Kyrat is a very big place and your characters movement is at the same pace of Jasons who is used to a smaller island, so therefore Jason moves slower. In Kyrat, everything is bigger and more spread out, so to compensate, Ajay should move a little quicker. Its just little things like that. Theres few new weapons and vehicles, but there are a variety of different animals. I played the game on hard mode, and comparatively to the last installment, this time around it was frustrating. The last Far Cry was challenging and had an awesome balance. When you died it was always fair and it was because of your own doing. In this one, hard mode was irritating. I even had a buddy watching me play and I quote, he said, Dude, straight up, even Im getting mad watching you play this. That was bullsh!t. The RPG elements are back with the attributes of the Tiger and Elephant and its all of the same skills from the previous and theres no backstory or tatau kind of thing to them. You just unlock them and get them.  Co-op: This time around instead of doing a set of missions set aside for coop, this one is almost drop-in/out. You and your buddy can go anywhere in the world and tackle fortresses and camps and hunt and do all single player things together. It was awesome, but it wasnt fun. Theres really no incentive or specialty to play coop, its kind of there just to be there. And the fact that theres no main co-op missions hinders the feature. My buddy joined my game and I was a lot farther than him so I already had outposts beat, animals hunted, and fortresses taken over, etc. so there was just nothing to do in my game, we had to start a new session in his world.;6801;I can almost guarantee youre only reading this because youre wondering if this Far Cry goes above and beyond what Ubisoft did in number three.

1472;Thats it. Little game, little review.;I would like to start off by saying the game looks pretty good. Its not that cheesy cel shading youll catch in a Spongebob game, or intense like The Wind Waker, but it has a nice smooth graphical effect to it. The artwork, you know what, hold on... I want to put out on all developers right now that, if youre going to create an adaptation of something already critically acclaimed, keep as much originality to it as you can. This game had original artists, composers, writers, they kept the voice actors... bruh. Nothing was skewed, nothing was questionable, nothing was crappy. Except the cutscenes, they were a little cheap (and by cheap, I mean budget cheap). It was all collaboration work. And that to me, was the most impressive aspect of the game.  Second would be the bending. It was really cool and each bending style has its own actual play style. It wasnt just the same spin-flip-kick with different colors. For instance, Earth is your slow heavy hitter. Water is your long range, and airbending is your crowd control. I actually didnt like firebending, I thought it was the suckiest of the four. You can dodge, parry, all of that. Controls are pretty tight for the most part, but the mechanics are a little broken. Your true skill is tested within the pro bending arena, which I thought was pretty fun and addictive. And the game has a little bit of difficulty to it, not gonna lie.  Low points of the game though would be enemy redundancy, the awkward temple-run mini game, the story, and the overall length. The story, while its own, takes place between seasons. If you havent seen the show (I dont know who else would be playing the game if they havent), then more than likely youll be a little lost if you dont pay attention. But in all honesty, I wouldve waited a good two years if this game couldve been fleshed out. The market isnt big enough for a AAA Korra game, and Im alright with that. But when you get a good dev studio where the games core image is already in their niche the result could be pretty decent.;7877;Im going to make this a quick review. The new Legend of Korra video game was made by the guys over at Platinum, who  put out Bayonetta 2.

1473;Retro Science Fiction at its best. It was a rollercoaster of events and motions. I know I didnt go in detail but Bioshock Infinte knows how to present its story. Thats what this game is about. Its not the graphics, its not the gameplay, its the story. This is one of the few games you have to finish to what its all about.;So the game starts out with you on a rowboat with this man and woman talking nonsense and arguing and blah blah but then you get dropped off at a lighthouse. The premise is creepy and Im already in a world of mystery. I sit down in a chair, and then everything changes. I honestly dont know where to begin with this game. I would like to talk about the story, but at the same time I dont. Its pacing is perfect and the amount of detail to make the story believable was so overwhelming it was awesome. The visuals are an art style, if you know Bioshock then you know theyre all about the whole throwback eras. Just one more distinction that makes this game stand out. The actors execution was absolutely flawless. 2K picked a perfect cast and this is one of Troy Bakers best if you ask me. The actual sound design was unique, the sci-fi was believable, and all sounds were recorded in mono which I thought was smart because it never became a blah blend that Call of Duty is know for (in the sound world) and the sound stage and spatial awareness was great. Almost perfect. The actual gameplay and control scheme were recycled, and when this game came out, it was in the market when FPSs where at a high but it did work for the better and there was never a time where I would hit random buttons because I got confused in hairy situations. Controls were tight and I always knew what I was doing. I played it on Hard Mode from the get go and they were not messing around. Hard Mode is actually hard. Not irritating hard, but challenging hard. When you play it, you wont break your controller in a rage, youll just go, damn! and pick right up where you left off. And also, if these plasmids were available to everyone, then why was it that the protagonist was the only one using them? That was the only gap I noticed in the game, and that was actually brought to my attention by someone else. The only downside to I thought to this game was not the ending, but the last level. It was one of those cliched throw everything at you all at once and it was actually the easiest part of the game. I go through this whole game constantly low on health, ammo, money, and I get to the end and beat it first try. It was actually too easy.;538;Bioshock went through a lot. Constant delays, management and team leaders leaving in the middle of development, quite a bit of stuff. I actually wasnt going to get this game because I thought the first one, while good, was repetitive, and I didnt even have any interest in the second one. But man, the hype was real with this one.

1474;This game takes what every other game has done and combines it nicely, although imperfectly. Monolith managed to make it their own, and they got pretty creative with it. I was very surprised because with games like Condemned and F.E.A.R., I didn’t know what to expect. The story is engaging (although a little short), the gameplay works well enough, and I did catch myself going back to it to play more. With just a LITTLE BIT more polish it would be nothing short of great.   Reason: The bugs, unresponsiveness, and lack of soundtrack left it just shy of an 8. If the story was longer (and still as engaging), then it would easily be a nine.;The main feature in ME:SOM is its Nemesis System, and it hits it right on the forge. Uruks rise to power and your objective is to liquidate them of their rank. The twist is that when you die, the same Orc that killed you will get promoted, and eventually even become a captain. Then, when you go back to get your revenge kill, you’ll cross blades and he will look you in the eye and say something like, “I killed you… I don’t understand.” Or they will spit in your face and say, “Coming back from the dead won’t phase me, I’ll make sure you stay dead this time!” It was badass and immersive. Each enemy also has their own different motives, personality, and array of strengths and weaknesses that actually add an interesting strategy element that could either help you or hurt you (depending on your environment). There was even a moment where I died, and the same guy that killed me rose up the ranks from a level six, to an ELEVEN. It was ridiculous. You’d best believe that I still made him my b*tch though.  Narrative: The story is a revenge tale in which  your family is killed in front of you by some tall pale dude in a hood called The Black Hand and you’re goal is to kill him with the help of a wraith that possesses you. But, the only way to get to him is by killing through the ranks so you can work your way up to him and whoop that ass.  EyeCandy: The first thing I want to talk about are the animations, the executions, combat, stealth, mounts, grappling, all of that! The way that all of the characters move and interact is incredible. Rarely did I ever see a repeat in animations, or two NPCs moving exactly the same when they were side by side. It was very smooth and very awesome. Graphically though, the game isn’t anything special. It does look good, and it does run well. There was a couple times where the frame rate would drop  but, it didn’t happen too often to where it would be a problem. There’s really not much to say about the graphics. To be honest, if you’ve played or seen a LOTR game, then you already know what it looks like, fifty shades of brown, and everything is in ruins.  Sound: The sound really isn’t that robust, but the voice acting is. I don’t even think I came across the same voice when I was fighting the captains because I know for a fact that I didn’t hear a repeat of dialogue. What stuck out the most though was battling the Warchiefs. As you start slaughtering your way up through the chain and you’re battling these Uruks, the Warchief will come out like Ben Stiller in Zoolander and have their own little intro sequence, kind of like in Borderlands. The music will start chanting their name, each with their own unique kind of jingle, and then you get down. Nothing else stuck out that was significant though. The battle music was basically that of Skyrim’s Dovahkiin theme and the SFX were generic, not all that custom, or Hi-Res, and the audio mix during the story’s cinematics sucked.  Gameplay: Now for the important part, the meat and potatoes. Shadow of Mordor’s gameplay is an exact copy pasta of two games, Assassin’s Creed, and the Batman Arkham series. The combat and level system is an EXACT MIRROR of Arkham, and almost everything else tries a little too hard to take from AC. It has the ‘Wraith World,’ which is just Eagle Vision. You scale these towers to hit a forge at the top and it’s SOM’s version of synchronizing. And at times the character will try and stick himself to a wall or ledge, or just not climb at all and it does get frustrating. The combat is good, but at times it was unresponsive, or there was a slight delay and the game wouldn’t register what button you pressed. This was especially bad when fighting a crowd of enemies. It makes the game difficult in a bad way.;3025;It’s Lord of the Rings, and it’s rated mature.

1475;The game is good. I recommended it to people all the time when I worked in retail. I don’t know, maybe it’s just me. It’s like a James Cameron film: clichéd but very well presented. Overall, it felt like a lazy river ride with a couple of rapids.;So first off, I’m pretty big on detail. I’m real big on the tech that goes behind these video games. Like the reflections and displacement of the water, the dynamic lighting, patterned and seamless textures, mocap and custom animations, things of that nature. And technologically, this game stands out bar none. Everything from the art and the visuals to the facial expressions. This game LOOKS incredible. Absolutely astounding. Every environment had the perfect feel and tone to it and everything fit just right. Even the sound design, while not superb, was still executed very well. I was pleasantly surprised with the effects and ambiance. Not too big on the soundtrack though. I actually thought the soundtrack was the weakest part of the game and Im pretty big on music and soundtracks. But enough of that, let’s get down to the meat and potatoes.  The controls are somewhat simplistic. Not too fancy, not too many combination controls. Pretty straight forward. The actual gameplay is somewhat repetitive though. It’s a survival horror, I get it. But you could always tell when conflict was about to happen. Or at least when human interaction was about to happen. Ellie can’t swim? Ok, cool, just go get that convenient pallet that seems to be chilling in every single body of water around the world. Just an example of the little things like that.  The infected were relentless and brutal and felt somewhat unpredictable. They really had that unstable feel to them. But the confrontation with the infected (when I played) was a little broken. When you’re getting manhandled by a runner and you’re trying to get out of deaths grasp, there would be a clicker on standby, idling in the background, waiting to pounce. You see it in the background, and as soon as you got away, it would immediately cut to the death animation of the clicker. It went from one animation straight to the other with no in-between “air” time.  And I kid you not: I couldn’t press a single button in between the two. Even the fact that I had some shivs on deck didn’t matter. It could have been because I was on hard mode, but I felt a little bit cheated in that area.  Second, were the paths of the clickers. There were times where I’d keep having to go back to a checkpoint and I’d be crouched down at one place, and the clicker would go right past me like my sneak skill was legendary. But then when I died (for whatever reason) I would reload my checkpoint and go back to that same exact hiding spot. Then MAGICALLY the thing knows where I am and I’m dead. Then, when I did it again, nothing would happen. Blended right in like JP from Grandma’s Boy. I mean, ok.  A little frustrating, but not a game breaker.  As far as the story goes, I thought it was very predictable. And to be honest, I never felt the chemistry between Joel and Ellie. It just didn’t feel natural. It was like they had a good rapport. It felt very redone. Troy Baker’s performance (mocap and voice-acting) was really good. And Ashley Johnson’s voice really stuck out, definitely kid like, but just a semitone out of place but that’s purely my opinion on the voice. Anyways, I called almost all the outcomes of the scenarios (even though I played the game late, I still made sure to stay away from any spoilers). The secondary characters were my favorite. They stuck out more than the main characters did and I felt that the relationship between them and the protagonists were a lot stronger than the main two.;1009;I didn’t get to play The Last of Us until about a week after it came out and while I was waiting to play it I kept seeing memes, commercials, reviews, peer talk, etc hype up the game.

1476;A wonderful video game experience that never gets boring and can gives you hours of fun. It is updated and changed regularly and is incredibly addictive.;Minecraft does not really have a story, it is just a game where you can do pretty much whatever you want to do. It is basically like video game lego. The graphics are not great, and look a bit dated but they bring charm to the game and they are a paramount importance to the games look. The game runs incredibly smoothly on Xbox one, and there are never really any glitches. Playing with friends is a lot of fun but playing by yourself is just the same.

It follows an indiana jones like charcter Nathan Drake who is trying to find a the cintimani stone. The game has a truck load of characters that are all either funny, evil, annoying and just plain fun. The game has brilliant dialogue in it and the voice acting is perfect. The multi-player aspect to the game is also very enjoyable. Normally for a game so story driven the multiplayer sucks. But this one doesnt, it was pleasantly addictive and enjoyable.

1478;The game is not Play how you want, its play it how we secretly want you to. The gameplay is good and the mechanics and formula are all there, the level design is good, story, meh, but the artwork is good as well. But what I did not appreciate, was being punished for playing how I wanted.;For some reason when I played this game, I didnt want to stealth my way around. I had a lot of fun with combat in the intro so I decided thats exactly how Im gonna do it. Up-front-in-your-face-full-assault. If I see it,  I kill it. But thats not to say that I didnt utilize the stealth at all, I did. I actually made it so I would set up my massacres from the shadows and jump down and have myself a good ol slaughterfest. But I want to talk about how punishing this game is. Not punishing as in Dark Souls, but punishing as in disciplinary. If the devs boasted that I could play whatever style I want, then how come I cant get a 100% completion unless I do stealth? The more people you kills, the more rats infest the city. Which is cool... I guess? But the rats are hostile, and then theyre everywhere so Im fighting off these annoying rats, and enemies. I mean, I know I said I like fighting but thats just not how it works. Second, if I want all of the bonuses and extras and the top score, I HAVE to play stealth. If I want all of the achievements and trophies and awards, I HAVE to play stealth. If I want the intended ending of the game, I HAVE to play stealth. You get the point.;533;Dishonored is a play it your way type of game that gives the player a multitude of options to finish the game how you would want.;Not Play as you want Punished if not played correctly;12;Combat Stealth Mechanics RPG elements;Dishonored Written Review;1370;14361

1486;Tagpro is a simple and yet challenging game.  It requires teamwork and skill, and is incredibly rewarding.  The learning curve can be steep, but in general, the community is oriented towards the mutual improvement of all its members.  Tagpro is a ton of fun, and its strategy makes it an addictive and rewarding experience.;TagPro is a 4v4 capture the flag game that features acceleration based movement and a birds-eye-view perspective.  Teams are organized into red and blue teams, and games typically are restricted to a 12-minute timer or a three-cap victory.  Players are either red or blue balls, circles rolling on the play area. Players can use boosts, a handful of powerups, and team-sensitive gates to strategically navigate the map and defend their flag while attempting to capture the enemy flag and return it to theirs to cap and score a point.   There are two main variations to gameplay.  The first is traditional CTF, with each team trying to capture the enemy flag (by rolling over it) and returning it to their base to cap (by rolling over their flag while carrying the enemy flag).  If any opposing player touches the flag-carrier, they are popped and the flag is instantaneously returned to the defending base.  The second variation is a neutral-flag gameplay mode, in which a yellow flag is located at the centre of the map and players must try and carry it to a scoring area at the enemy end of the map. Contact between a defender and the enemy flag-carrier causes the flag to change hands to the defender that made contact. The powerups are as follows: Note that powerups pups respawn sixty seconds after a player has rolled over them. Tagpro: when a player rolls over the tagpro powerup, a green circle appears around the edge of their ball. They can now pop tag any player, not just the enemy flag carrier. Rolling Bomb: When a player rolls over the rolling bomb powerup, their ball adopts a smoking appearance.  If any enemy player comes into contact with them, the bomb explodes, and the enemy player is launched a distance away.  This is useful for a flag carrier, because it grants one touch of immunity to being tagged. Juke Juice: TagPro is all about juking enemy players, so juke juice is particularly useful.  It provides increased acceleration and speed. TagPro can be played competitively, and various leagues exist.  Most players play in pubs, games with randomized teams in location oriented servers. There is an in-game chat function that provides team-private and general chat.   Players can earn flairs, little symbols that accompany their ball along with their username, for achieving levels or special event achievements.  The level of a player is displayed along with their username, and is earned based on their number of wins. Players can form groups in the servers, and move from game to game as a group of players. For special dates, (like Easter or April Fools Day) the developers will sometimes introduce a new gamemode for a day or two. This review doesnt encompass everything, and I apologize for any errors.;9604;Id describe myself as a casual gamer, and never really got into console gaming.

1487;Very enjoyable experience, cant wait to play it again!;The game has a simple concept: grab the enemy flag, and bring it to your own flag, and score a point! If the opponents grab your flag, then you can run into them, and pop them. They get sent back to their base, and your flag goes back to your base. There are some ways to make capturing the flag easier, such as powerups, boosts to let you go faster, bombs to snipe the enemy holding the flag, etc. There are typically two positions in games, offense (grab the flag, and juke your way past the opponents), and defense (prevent your flag from getting taken, and dont let yourself get juked, or you may end up on a highlight reel!). Overall, a very enjoyable game. Games are 4v4. You can play with other people across the internet, or play in a group with your friends.;9604;I started playing Tagpro about 1.5 years ago, around Thanksgiving.

I personally dont like the default vanilla look of the game, so I play with a texture pack. Please, go play Tagpro now!;Tagpro has several different obstacles on each level, or map as we call them. Spikes kill all who touch them, gates change color (green kills all, gray kills none, blue/red kill the opposite color). Also, boosts will make you zoom along faster, bombs when touched or triggered by a button send out a shockwave, and powerups make you accelerate faster, let you kill other balls, or give you a one-time immunity from being touched, depending on which one you grab. To score a point (we call them caps, short for captures), you first have to grab the other teams flag. But be careful! Once you have the other teams flag, anyone on the other team can kill you by touching you. If you successfully avoid the other team and get back to your own base, rolling over your own flag with theirs scores a point. For you to score, the other team must not have your flag at the same time. Basic strategy and etiquette dictates that on your team of 4, 2 people should play offense, and 2 should play defense. The two playing offense try to take the other teams flag, and the two playing defense prevent the other team from taking their flag, but if the other team manages to take their flag, the two defenders should chase the FC (flag carrier) of the other team.;9604;Hi, my name is I_mess_up, and Im a TagPro addict.

1493;The kings of RTS, formerly known as Westwood Studios, going by the name of Petroglyph Games have crafted a solid game that not only welds the formula that they created back with C&C with the new generation of games epitomised by Star Craft 2 but is also well balanced with vastly different race play styles. If you are an RTS nut like myself then you probably have already picked up grey goo and if you havent I would recommend doing so. If you are a little hesitant about dropping the full retail price then wait for the first significant price drop as Grey Goo is a game that wont punish late adopters like Star Craft 2 and will still feature that brilliantly crafted single player story.;Grey Goo is a brand new intellectual property, something that feels all too rare nowadays and even rarer is a real time strategy game. I originally thought the name was silly until I did some googling and came across the hypothetical end of the world scenario where rampant self replicating nano-sized robots  would devour every living thing on the planet in the search for  greater material with which to build more of itself. This piqued my interest. Then it was released that the creators of this game were video game developers Petroglyph Games made up of the original members of Westwood Studios, the creators of the Command and Conquer series. The prodigal sons had returned. Needless to say this game has been riding the hype train amongst lovers of the RTS genre ever since its announcement, as RTS lovers have been left wanting for games to play, I mean unless you have some kind of genetic mutation that makes you immune to the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome and are still playing Star Craft 2.  Grey Goo is thankfully a good game, perhaps even very good with the potential to become excellent if its developers continue to support the game and listen to the community that has quickly grown up around the game. Like its spiritual predecessors C&C and Star Craft it comprises of three different factions, a technologically advanced human race that has a horde of artificial intelligent controlled machines to wage war with, the alien Betas that use the power of industry to build powerful mechanised war vehicles and lastly the most interesting of them the titular grey goo who are giant blobs of nano-machines that absorb all in their path to replicate and spread throughout the map. While the humans and Beta ultimately play very similarly to each other and would be immediately recognisable to any passing RTS gamer with strong emphasis on base building, managing their economy and producing the correct variations of unit types the goo is an entirely different beast altogether and something that I havent seen done before.   The goo instead of having different  centres of production and resource gathering have just one unit called the mother goo that acts as a kind of mobile base, heavy unit and resource producer all in one. The mother goo moves between resource pools to collect material which it then uses to produce either another mother goo, light or heavy goos or an ultimate unit that wreaks devastation anywhere it goes. the light and heavy goos themselves can then morph into a slew of other units for specific tasks such as anti air or artillery support and can all be done in the heat of battle. The goo has a weakness, however, in that to effectively gather resources the numerous mother goos that you will ultimately have must be micromanaged much more than the other two races.  The humans have a strong focus on base building and have the odd mechanic that all of their buildings must be linked by power struts connected to the central base, while this at first seems unduly restricting it immediately becomes clear that without it humans would be near unstoppable. Humans enjoy a wide range of defensive turrets that the other two races are noticeably lacking in and gain access to strong air units remarkably fast making them masters of both defence and fast offense. The centralised base building ultimately makes it harder for the humans to maintain their supply lines as factories must be built close to the central hub while defenseless worker units must instead move across the map and into harms way. The alien Betas are a mixture of both the goo and the humans in that they have the ability to build structures anywhere they have line of sight meaning that they can spread rapidly across the map but each structure must be connected to a central power hub that is generally an easy target.   Grey Goo also features something that RTS games have been severely lacking in recent years being an excellent single player campaign. In the same vein as C&C the story of grey goo is shown through excellent videos before and after each mission while its predecessor benefitted from gloriously campy live action clips grey goo has beautifully rendered cg cut scenes. The story is well scripted and almost unbelievably contains characters that I actually care about. The control system has also been vastly improved from these earlier titles with the creation of a quick key control scheme based on the wasd keys which feels incredibly natural and makes you feel like a bad ass StarCraft 2 player in no time at all.  I started off talking about grey goo with the statement that it is a good game but unfortunately it isnt great. I ran into slight fps drops towards the end of some games where the units involved can number in the thousands as each faction not only has its little worker bees scurrying around for loot but also the hundred or so combat units clashing against one another, it only happened a handful of times but I suspect those with battlestations even a little worse off than myself will experience issues. The longevity of the game is also an issue as I have put approximately 40 hours into the game as of my writing this and am starting to slow down as there are limited official maps so far and many of my online games all fell very much the same. This will undoubtedly improve in the coming weeks as more people begin to play, however, its something that was constantly on my mind as I played.;8232;;Feels poorly optimised, however, may be improved on later with updates The formula doesnt have the staying power that other RTS games arguably have;6;Interesting playable races that mix up the RTS formula Great control scheme Fully fleshed out story with beautiful CGI cutscenes;This Goo will stick around;2618;16673
1494;For a free game, it honestly cant be beat!;Tagpro is basically as a simple of a game as you can get, while still being really, really, REALLY fun. The controls are: arrow keys or WASD to move. Thats it. Its the same for everyone else. There are powerups you can pick up on the map, but otherwise everyone has the same control, it is completely a game of skill. There are a ton of different maps that get rotated through for play, most of which are community created, and new music is created by the community and added as well! The devs actually play the game, take suggestions, and create completely new and fun game modes for special holiday events!

1495;Bloodborne is easily one of the best games Ive ever played. This game is the furthest From has gone from the Dark Souls formula (besides Armored Core) and its payed off in easily one of the most unique gaming experiences of the past decade. I wont lie- it isnt without its share of issues- but whenever those issues rear their ugly heads, they are soon lost in Bloodbornes enthralling world.;The first thing you do in Bloodborne after creating your character is fistfight a werewolf. Sold yet? No?   Alright, let me explain.    The opening to Bloodborne is actually quite different from the openings of previous From Software games. Theres a short cutscene that prompts you to create your character, but no opening cutscene explaining the lore of the world. Speaking of the character creator- its amazing. You can almost (note the almost, because some games just have ugly characters) always judge a character creator on how much of an abomination you can make the default character into, and by god, have some abominations been made. But they arent all ugly. The Joker is a popular design, as is Abraham Lincoln, whos evidently been referred to Yharnam after his time as a Vampire hunter. My character is modeled after the Norse God Odin. The character creator allows for complete control over all facial dimensions, much like Skyrim. Thats a big step up from Dark Souls creator. After your contract is completed, youre almost ready to face Yharnam. The werewolf fight is somewhat of a supposed-to-lose fight, but if you manage to beat him with the strange karate chops your character makes with their bare hands, you can proceed to the first level. As soon as you die, youre given your choice of three trick weapons and two firearms.  I would love to elaborate on the games levels, but Bloodborne is the sort of game you want to experience on your own. You dont want to know whats around the corner. You dont want to know what the next boss will look like or even what their name is. I suggest you be careful with youtube videos as well. Unraveling Yharnams mysteries is much more satisfying on your own. Just know that youre in for one of the most thrilling, mysterious, and addicting experiences ever had with a game. Ill talk about the games mechanics to avoid any spoilers.  I was never a fan of Souls combat, honestly. It was quite a shame, as I really enjoyed almost every other aspect of the games. Bloodborne has changed that. The game rewards fast-paced combat. Theres no shields (barring one put in as a joke), rolling is replaced with dashing when locked on, health can be regenerated if you manage you hit a nearby enemy fast enough (before you say streamlining, using this mechanic forces you to be greedy and gets you killed often), and you can move, albeit slowly, while healing. Fights are more frantic and every small mistake you make is extremely punishing. There are less weapons, but every weapon is a trick weapon. This means the weapon has two forms, ensuring your fighting style is always unpredictable. Firearms are wielded in the left hand, and range from a small pistol to a cannon. Firearms exist mainly for the sake of parrying and riposting, which requires you to fire your weapon while your enemy is mid-attack animation, causing them to stagger, whereupon you press R1 and rip their organs out with your right hand. It looks just as badass as it sounds.  Bloodborne is incredibly atmospheric from beginning to end. The NPCs are all well voice acted, the graphics are astounding, and the level design is top-notch, much better than Dark Souls IIs. The clothing on your characters back blows in the wind and flaps around gently with every movement you make. Many of the bosses are quite hairy or have something hanging off of them that moves beautifully as they attack. Blood simply pours out of enemies as you slash them, soaking your character as you slaughter more and more of them. One incredible detail I noticed was that getting covered in blood while wearing a full mask results in only the area around your eyes becoming blood-stained. Bloodborne simply does everything it sets out to do incredibly well without faltering or even seeming a bit over-the-top. One of the greatest things about Miyazaki and his team at From is that they can design broken worlds so well- Yharnam feels like a lived-in place thats run into some really, really bad times, much like New Londo did in Dark Souls. You might get used to dealing with a beast or two, you might think to yourself this isnt too bad, but Bloodborne will change that. Bloodborne will never leave you comfortable.  The games issues are mainly technical shortcomings. The framerate often dips, and while I personally think its more stable than Dark Souls framerate (nothing can be worse than Blighttown) its definitely noticeable.  PVP is very hit-or-miss- it can take 10 seconds to find somebody else or 10 minutes, and the netcode is a bit shoddy regardless. There are a few covenants but none of them really make significant changes to the PVP meta. PVP may sound like a bit of a disappointment, but the core mechanics save it. The PVP is fast-paced and exhilarating and the lack of sword-and-boarding and cheese magic makes it more skill based than ever before (note: there still is magic in the game, its just used less often).;7334;Bloodborne is From Softwares newest game, a unique twist on the Souls formula that is exclusive to the Playstation 4.;-Framerate issues are there, but in my experience never occur during combat nor boss fights. Framerate is more stable than Dark Souls 1 on 360/PS3 -Covenant system feels tacked on -Loading screens are a bit too long;48;-Incredible atmosphere -Amazing graphics, best clothing/hair Ive ever seen  -Best character creator in a Souls game so far  -Fast-paced, visceral combat -Lore is incredibly interesting  -Very difficult,  yet so rewarding  -Huge amount of content -Amazing voice acting  -PVP is more engaging and faster than in previous Souls games  -Interesting chalice dungeons  -Music is perfect  -The game transitions to lovecraftian nightmare so well -Terrifying boss and enemy designs -Weapons look badass and feel badass to use -So.

1496;TagPro isnt the prettiest game in the whole world, and you wont find yourself coming back for the graphics (...were just a bunch of balls!) but the gameplay is intoxicatingly good. Seriously, Ive never found a game that so perfectly towed the line between easy to pick up and deep enough to keep your attention. Seriously, one member has logged nearly 1600 hours. Were talking about a flash game here! Thats impressive as hell. This game wont get old and youll find that the strategies are complicated enough that its fun for all skill levels. The competitive scene is welcoming to new players and the tiered system works decently well to pair you with competitive players of a similar skill level.;The beauty of TagPro is that while the controls are simple, the physics are hard to master. You have to remain aware of your momentum and your angle. Its more akin to ice hockey than basketball -- if you find yourself out of position (called getting behind) then youll have to hope that circumstances shift in your favor. This is a thoughtful, strategic and well-thought-out game. The community is excellent (shout out to /r/TagPro) and there are tons of great players who play regularly. Like any gaming community, there are some bad apples and not all new players are treated perfectly well on their first games, but in general, I dont hesitate to say its the best community that Ive been a part of. People are extremely helpful, particularly once they know that youre new to the game. People genuinely want newcomers to get good. The competitive TagPro scene is alive and well! There were approximately 800 people involved in competitive TagPro this season and the sense of camaraderie nurtured by competitive TagPro is the best gaming experience that Ive ever had. The only complaint I have at all is with the website. At times, it can be a bit clunky when it comes to placing you in a game and group features could use a little bit of work. These are very, VERY, minor flaws.;9604;TagPro has swallowed me whole. I stumbled upon it sometime in early 2014 and rediscovered it later that year. Its one of those games that you dont realize that youve been playing for six hours until you notice that the sun is rising. Its simple, the controls are intuitive and the graphics are serviceable. Youre a ball. Your goal is to capture the flag. You play in 4v4 teams. The simplicity of the game is what hooks you.;Matchmaking clunkyness;82;Controls Physics-driven gameplay Learning curve Community Competitive Scene Balance;Easy to Learn  Impossible to Master;2650;16689
1497;My overall experience was very great, considering I have spent a significant amount of time playing TagPro.;I think TagPro is particularly unique because of its awesome community. The game itself is quite simple, but nonetheless fun and intriguing. Every moment you play, you feel the intense action of the game. This action is translated into even more interesting activities in the community, via TagPro Leagues such as MLTP. Ive participated in these leagues, and I can attest to the greatest and fun times offered by them.;9604;Hello, I am Fre$h, and I have played TagPro.;I feel the banning system isnt very effective.

1498;The Thousand Year Door is like many other RPGs, but its mechanics and writing are polished to a mirror shine. Do not let the age be off-putting  Not only has the game aged well, but its charm and mechanics will likely transcend its age.;Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is a blissful role-playing game that in every way improves on its successor. Its light story and consistently humorous dialogue makes it a perfect choice for any lover of games. Behind the distinctly colourful world lies untold depth.  The game begins in the drab city of Rogueport, a drab, seedy town with many humorous, morally grey characters. The initial brownness of the town and grey tones of the sewers quickly fade to levels that feel entirely at home in a Mario game, and burst with color. From quaint villages to draconic strongholds, there is very rarely a time when a room is not filled with chroma across the spectrum  The combat is also incredibly well-polished, and require the player to take a deceptively active role in the details of battles, despite a simple turn-based system. Action commands ensure the player is always responsible for the outcome of battles, while stylish moves hide secrets in the combat that players will discover over time. The variance of these commands ensure that fighting with different partners feels very different.  A remarkably deep character customization system ties with combat to leave the player with even more diverse character builds to create. The badge system allows characters to choose combat buffs or new moves in the form of badges, which take a quantity of badge points that may be increased by leveling up.  The aforementioned basics may be found in many great role-playing games, but the one quality that sets The Thousand Year Door apart is its world. Everything feels alive. All characters always have a consistent and developing story throughout the game, and interaction reveals this through the incredibly clever, well-written dialogue. Even background characters typically have a very diverse set of dialogue depending on ones progress throughout the game.;3349;I picked up this game on the original GameCube, and have gone through multiple disks before eventually ripping it for Dolphin.

1500;Overall, there were phases of interest and disinterest. The community merely prolonged the interest, but there is no factor that will make somebody play TagPro for years and years.;As a concept, it is not very exciting. A 2D ball voyages to the other side of the map, grabs the flag, and brings it back. However, it has been implemented in such a way that creates vast strategy, often forcing split-second decisions that can dramatically alter the outcome of the match. These strategies come to fruition in three main ways: human enemies, human teammates, and the physics. When trying to bring the flag back, one must beat the enemies in a race of sorts to their own base. This can be done by taking the optimum paths, tricking the opponents, or by simply outmaneuvering them. It requires an extreme amount of situational awareness that can only be developed over time. Being good on your own is great, but your teammates can either carry you to victory or cause your defeat. Teamwork is vital, and this is done by protecting the flag carrier or protecting your own flag. It is also very important to have a full team, as each new player greatly increases the chance of victory. But with a lot of ways to kill your own teammates (added fun), be careful not to let the other team have an advantage. There isnt that much of this, or of rage quitting. The physics are why most people play, I believe. Apart from the basics, there are countless nuances that take weeks to even realize and months to get the hang of. After a year of playing, though, it gets pretty redundant.;9604;I am Atrazine and have played TagPro for about a year now.

1501;Despite some missteps in design and execution, Little Inferno is a very solid game, despite its experimental nature.;Little Inferno has some very interesting, experimental gameplay. Clicking and burning will only get one so far, but it is sometimes fun to see what effects burning different things will yield. One may order items from a catalogue with money obtained from burning, and they will be delivered in real time ranging from five seconds to a few minutes. This allows the game to pace itself out to two hours, but does so at the expense of gameplay.  The combo system is one of the games saving graces for replayability and pace. Burning two or three predesignated items together will reward some instant-delivery tokens and money. This incentivizes burning different items and will offset some of the annoyance of the delivery system.  The soundtrack is probably the best part of the game. Give the game a shot, but be sure to experience the entire soundtrack - Kyle Gablers compositions fit perfectly into the games warm atmosphere, and many of the tracks are genuinely entertaining to listen to - even for somebody who doesnt listen to soundtracks.;1363;Little Inferno is good enough for a playthrough and some messing around.

This is the only game Ive played where user contribution is valued so highly. Every player has the opportunity to make maps and have their own map featured in the rotation. You can also have your own original music creations featured in the music rotation.

1507;Overall the game has a great story, for once. And the multiplayer is one of the best so far. The maps are more linear but i think thats better than huge maps that take about 5 minutes to get the place you want to get to. Visceral have proved that they can make a really good Battlefield game.;Battlefield Hardline is the newest game in the battlefield series. The story follows a cop who ends up working with dirty cops. The missions are incredibly fun, and visceral actually attempted a proper campaign. Instead of the same mission over and over again. The writing for the characters is hilarious and the missions are very big. The campaign isnt really that difficult, but you can do the campaign again on Hardline difficulty if you want to. Now lets get on to the main portion of the game. Multiplayer! The multiplayer in Battlefield Hardline is great. There are limited weapon choices but that would make sense for a cops and robbers game. Robbers dont normally carry an armory full of military weapons with them, so stop moaning about the gun choice. The cops have different weapons to the criminals, which is sometimes very annoying if you like a gun on the cop side. There are 8 maps all together so far, and they are all really well designed. Theyre not large like most battlefield maps but that can be a good thing. The new modes are very good as well. The Blood Money mode and the Heist mode are basically the same thing apart from in blood money the cops can get the money too. Hotwire mode is the most fun though. There are five cars on the map that if you take control of them and drive the cars really fast you start gaining points. This adds a lot of car chases to the game. Also they have added a money system so that instead of getting loads of kills with different weapons, you can just save up money and buy the weapon instead.;7081;Hi, Im EpicEnder99 and i will be reviewing Battlefield Hardline.;Campaign Missions Get Repetitive Sometimes.

1508;Overall the game is very fun and has a great story mode.

He has now comeback and is working with the San Francisco PD and is infiltrating the Triads. But he seems to have become a little bit too involved in the way the Triads run. And is now very popular amongst the Triads. The game runs very smoothly and the graphics are stunning on xbox one. The driving mechanics in the game are not very good and driving around feels a bit clunky. The streets of Hong Kong feel alive in the game and it makes you believe you are actually there. There are lots of different activities you can do other than the story missions. There are collectibles. A martial art club, where you can fight it out in a ring with many opponents trying to attack you. And there are street races. The writing and voice acting is very good. There is a slow motion bullet time part of the game , where if you are holding a gun and you vault over something it goes into bullet time. This is very helpful at times. And if you have a gun and you aim out of the window of a car it goes in slow motion, this causes lots of very cool car crashes and chases. There is no multiplayer though. And there is a very good parkour system that alows you to get to places quicker than usual, unless you drive a car.;1267;Hi, Im EpicEnder99 and i will be reviewing Sleeping Dogs.;Driving is bad No Multiplayer;49;Amazing Story Great Slow Motion Bullet Time Great Parkour;GTA But in Hong Kong.;1750;17167

They all have a completely different design and have different obstacles to avoid, like cars, walls,trees, etc. In every map there are also different cars you can drive, this adds more variety.

1512;Great game, simplicity makes it amazing. Community is friendly and helpful. CREATE YOUR SOMEBALL;The beauty of the game lies in its simplicity.

There are also map features such as bombs and boosts which can be used to snipe opponents, and spikes for you to hug. The use of physics in the game is also amazingly impressive. With the use of spin incorporated onto the ball affecting your moment, and momentum being conserved against walls separates the maestros from the novices. The community. Centred on Reddit, with three mumble servers, the community is a friendly and welcoming place to share gifs and discuss all things TagPro.

You can and should play the game at tagpro.gg or join the community at reddit.com/r/tagpro.;Ill just give an explanation of each portion of the advanced rating I gave: - Story is a 10 because giving it a 0 for not being applicable wouldnt do TagPro justice. - Graphics are a 6  they should be improved on, both in the menus and in-game. This is why I highly recommend using a texture pack (dont worry, theyre easy to use). Occasionally graphical glitches will happen, but they do not interfere with the game and are usually due to lag. Unfortunately, the main menu is often a turnoff to newer players, being black and green. - Audio is an 9 because the music is good, and the sounds are good for a players first months. If they get annoying or loud they can be turned off or even replaced with the use of a userscript. Slight improvements could be made but the sounds are still good. - Controls are a 10 because they are sensible, modifiable (is that a word?), and easy to use.Very simple and very effective, not much to say here. Unfortunately, the tutorial is out-of-date and does not cover portals, superboosts, gravity wells, or neutral flags-- fortunately, those are encountered infrequently. - Fun is a 10 because its fun.

1517;Fantastic game, wish that more games had the community this one did.;For a game so simple where youre literally rolling around as a ball, it has so much depth. In fact, theres even several competitive leagues based on region where teams of top players practice and play against other teams in a fight to be the best. It may seem a bit too slow at first, but youll realize that this really adds to the depth of the game, as it allows you to have complete control over your ball. This can lead to you having amazing jukes to score a point, making incredibly skilled returns to save a cap, and other things that would not be possible if the game was made for those without patience. While you may run into some slightly rude people in public games (PUBS), there is a wonderful small community over at reddit.com/r/tagpro where everyone will be eager to help get you acquainted with the game. Also, if you tell people in public games that youre new (press enter to chat to everyone, t to chat to only your team, esc to exit chat), they will be much more understanding of your mistakes and even give you good pointers.

You can get tagged while carrying the flag (or by another player with the TagPro powerup, which allows them to tag balls even if theyre not carrying the flag).  You have to bring your opponents flag back to your flag while the opponents are not holding your flag to score. First to three wins. There are other hazards as well as two other powerups.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, the intro tells of a group of people been assigned for preservation of the human race from a catastrophic featuring an asteroid wiping out civilisation. Staring as one of people being preserved, you are woken up from your cryostasis in a preservation pod, finding out that youre the only one alive, once leaving the pod you find yourself in a desolate world surrounded by mutant, bandits and a group called the Authority.   The story is non-existent including your characters personality, back history, or even an authority and reason for yourself. The character being played is nothing more than a blank slate, ID Software (though never really praised for its story) failed horribly on this aspect of the game, most of the time, nothing was interesting about what you were doing or why you were doing it, every time you go out to fight, the sense of achievement is seldom. Even though ID Software tries to create some dynamic characters to interact with, all of them seem to have this inauthentic feel to their personality, though their designs of the character and clothing fit the bill of someone who has a certain type of personality, the dialogue and the voice acting is forced. When interacting with characters in a main mission, the game forces you to be with them at all time when giving their briefing, listening to what theyre saying, theres no skipping these moments nor is there anything interesting for them to say.Some quests and mission such as racing are also required to get through the game. ID Software could have done better.  But looking at some positives, RAGEs gunplay makes the game very enjoyable to play. Featuring the generic pistol, shotgun, sub machine gun and a few apocalyptic weapon. Each weapon packs it own punch, the fights and the AI interaction with the enemies you face can be a fantastic experience, each enemy has their own intelligence when fighting. This is possibly the best aspect to the game.  Audio is crisp and sounds great to listen to, with most sounds being quite authentic for the genre. The graphics are another positive, the developers have put extra special care into making some of the best graphics at the time, theres much artistic detail put into every nook and cranny of the environment (even if its somewhat generic). Though fantastic, the graphics PC version (which I own) has tons of texture pop-ups, every time I look at a valley or turn around, I see smudgy looking textures all over the place. This is part is unacceptable on the part of ID Software.;509;Verily such a game company that hypes up something using their well known company brand and their veteran game developers, to make sure that what the customer get is a high quality game with their expectations met. Sadly, after years in development (a five year gap since Quake IV), didnt make the cut a good game, RAGE was a disappointment.;- Graphical issues like texture popups - Bare bones story that has no value - Unskippable interactions with character and racing segments. - The player is nothing more than a blank slate.;6;+Gunplay is extremely good + Audio and Visual were wonderful to look at;What happens when the hype doesnt live up to expectations.;2977;17520
1519;Severance: Blade Of Darkness is one of the cornerstones of the genre of hack-n-slash games. Despite being fairly obscure due to bad marketing and the teeth-clenching difficulty, it is rightfully considered by many to be one of the best examples of how a sword combat should be handled. Blade Of Darkness teaches a painful lesson to those accustomed to jumping and clicking their way out of any fight  its challenging and at times frustratingly unforgiving – but in the end, it all pays off when a visceral, beautiful fight ends up with you standing and your enemy having his head chopped off.  Besides combat, the game offers breathtakingly beautiful scenery and architecture, real-time shadows (a very impressive feature for a game made in 2001!) and overall amazing graphics for its time. It has aged very well in this regard, looking gorgeous even more than 10 years later. From a compatibility point of view, you may need to download a DLL or two to ensure the game runs well on modern machines (solutions to a few of the most frequently encountered problems are mentioned in the review), but no extraordinary measures are needed – you might even get BOD to run flawlessly on your computer straight out of the box if youre lucky.  If you dont mind a game that wont let you stroll through it casually, if the thought of intense beautifully choreographed fights fascinates you and if you havent heard about this hidden gem yet, dont hesitate. Youre in for a world of fun.;Let me get this straight, right from the first paragraph – Blade Of Darkness isnt a walk in the park. Its challenging and fairly unforgiving, brutally punishing those who rush happily at their first enemy with a sword in their hand by chopping their head off. Severance requires quite a bit of discipline, caution and patience – but if you possess all that, its going to be one of the most rewarding and fun games youve ever played.  If I had to summarize this game with just one word, it would have to be combat. BOD puts combat above everything else, combat is its heart and core. The combat mechanics were fairly revolutionary at the time of its release  while the fighting system of most other hack-n-slash games of that time (Enclave, Rune...) consisted of the players character jumping around and click-spamming the enemies, combat in Blade Of Darkness instead resembles a fighting game like, say, Mortal Kombat – although not as hectic and far more strategic. A fighting game in third-person view would be a fairly fitting description  while the camera is kept behind the characters back at all times, the combat consists of blocking, attacking and performing keyboard combos – and keeping an eye on the characters stamina and everything else going on around you, because the other enemies wont hesitate to attack you while youre busy trying not to get killed by that one troll with a poisoned sword in front of you. Every fight is truly an adrenaline rush – no matter how confident you are, the harsh reality is that the ork around the next corner can chop you to pieces just as easily as that fearsome minotaur that youve just defeated.  To make things better (or, perhaps, worse, depending on how you look at it), the movement and combat feels heavy and slow-ish, making it impossible to just jump and click your way out of every situation. The characters can indeed dodge and jump out of the way of the enemys blade if youre quick enough to react, but if you hope that you can pull that off in a small room with a few enemies, youre in for a rude awakening. Every blow and every slash of the sword feels heavy, no matter if its your club hitting an enemy knight or his sword cutting through your flesh. Its outright impossible to simply click your foes to death. Like it or not, youll have to learn to fight efficiently and skillfully.  But once you master this skill, every fight becomes a beautiful dance rather than a challenge. The succession of dodges, quick stabs, blocks and well-timed combos is an entrancing and captivating sight, something that turns the fight into a product of intuition rather than precise calculation. Has the enemy started doing that particular attack that exposes his side? Go for a quick swing from the left. Or raise your weapon for a second, blocking his move, and counter-attack with a fierce diagonal cut. Rebel Act did an amazing job, making the gameplay fluid and intuitive, hard enough to keep your teeth clenched but incredibly rewarding when it all pays off at the end and you successfully chop the head off that ork and watch it fly across the room with spurts of blood painting the walls red.  Speaking of that, the game is notoriously violent and outright gory – something that only adds to the satisfaction after defeating a difficult enemy. Heads, limbs and pieces of torsos are all perfectly detachable when it comes to sharp weapons applied to them, with obligatory blood pools completing the picture – and the playable characters arent safe from having their limbs chopped off, too. Furthermore, the hacked off gibs can be picked up and carried around and even used as weapons in their own right – not particularly efficient weapons, sure, but definitely intimidating ones. The same applies to just about any other object of right size in the game – anything from bones to stools can be picked up and used to hit enemies with.  But it would be a lie to say that all that this game has to offer is combat. Oftentimes, youll find yourself running around temples and tombs, palaces and ancient ruins trying to solve a mystery or (most often) open a particular gate or door to advance through the level. A game with a brilliant combat system but terrible location design would be a huge disappointment – thankfully, Severance isnt one. Whether its a foggy circular fortress or a creepy island of the dead, ruins of an ancient city in the middle of the rainforest or a sand-swept temple in the desert, all the locations are absolutely beautiful and atmospheric – and, lets admit it, that is quite a compliment for a game released in 2001. Some of the architecture and sceneries are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, making you stop all the running and fighting for a minute just to admire the view. Drawing influence from various cultures around the world (mainly those located in the Fertile Crescent, but reaching as far as India and even South America for one location), the level design has amazing style to it, fully immersing the player into the world of the game. At the same time, with all their richness and beauty, the locations never feel safe. Both the dark and gloomy levels and the bright and sun-caressed ones have that feeling of disturbance to them, making you look behind your back every now and then and expect a foe to jump at you from any recess in the wall. Occasionally, Blade Of Darkness takes a nosedive straight into the horror genre, making you visit dark creepy dungeons and towers of necromancers – and even a pitch-black crypt once, where you have to fight through hordes of mummified zombies in the flickering light of your torch that has an annoying tendency of burning out.  Speaking of torches and pitch-black crypts, Blade Of Darkness loves playing with light and shadows. It was one of the first games – if not the first one – that featured real-time volumetric shadows, and, as if that was not enough, shadows from several sources of light at once – which is truly an impressive feature for a game from 2001. The graphics of Severance were fantastic at the time of its release – for 2001, it was essentially what Crysis was for 2007, a benchmark and a new standard for videogame graphics. In addition to the games of shadows mentioned above, the graphics quality plays a defining role in the beauty of architecture and landscapes described in the previous paragraph. When you see a sacred temple of a deity, sculpted with meticulous attention to detail, or a cold fortress of the knights atop the mountain, with patches of snow covering passageways between its high stone walls, it is sometimes hard to believe that something this beautiful and detailed was made in 2001. In this regard, the game has aged astonishingly well, enemy models being just about the only thing that immediately doesnt look modern at first glance.  Music is something else that adds to the atmosphere greatly. It suits the events of the game perfectly  its rich and beautiful when youre exploring deserted areas and taking in the magnificent views, its tense and exciting when youre battling a difficult enemy, its epic and solemn during some of the games most climactic scenes and fights. It can be chilling and creepy in dark dungeons, but then it will smoothly change to a lighter ambient score once you make it to an outdoor area. Overall, sans some somewhat cheesy suspense effects, the sound design of Severance is brilliant – its definitely a shame that the games score was never released separately. While all the sounds and music of BOD are easily accessible in the games folder, the audio quality is quite mediocre, some of the music pieces being mono wavs sampled at 22 kHz, others – 128 kbps mp3s.  The player has four playable characters to choose from, each character specializing in his or her types of weapons and fighting style. Each of the characters has their own unique starting level and their own story, although the storyline differences between them disappear fairly early into the game. Most new players love the Barbarian, with his two-handed swords and cool-looking attacks, although he might be a bit too difficult for the first-time players. A balanced choice for a first playthrough would be the Knight, with his efficient use of shields and easy to master combos. Additionally, his starting level was the one bundled with the demo of the game, so it was meticulously polished and demonstrates the games mood and gameplay features very well. The Amazon is also a good choice for first-timers, though playing with her feels almost cheatingly easy at times, with her long-range attacks and the ability to quickly roll far enough out of harms way (although her starting level is actually quite the opposite of cheatingly easy!). I definitely wouldnt recommend playing with the Dwarf on your first playthrough, though, since playing with him has a very high chance of rage quits and throwing the keyboard out of the window in frustration. In any case, once youve completed the game with one character, what could be better than starting it over with another one, just to see how well youll manage this time? BOD has fantastic replayability. Besides, over the years, the fan community has created countless mods and singleplayer maps to check out, some of these maps rivaling the original campaign in their detail and complexity.  Perhaps the only serious downside of the game is its story. Its not that the storyline is inherently bad – on the contrary, the game is set in a world heavily influenced by Zoroastrian teachings and the Earth-that-was a few dozen centuries ago  the story is a prime example of the monomyth found in many cultures and has a couple of (admittedly, fairly cliched) plot twists. The real problem is that the storyline could have easily not existed here at all. Most of the time, all youre doing is going from one door to another, trying to find keys and gems while fighting abominations and evil guys and admiring the atmosphere – and wondering why youre here. Its not that the story is nonsentical, has plot holes or is unrelated to whats actually happening on the screen – but the only times when it actually surfaces are level intros and intermission screens with the narrator saying a few words about the place, and occasional cutscenes that are few and far between. To figure out whats actually going on, the player has to pay rigorous attention to these small bits of information, then piece them together and speculate on things that were left unsaid or just mentioned briefly in the passing. If you go through the trouble of actually doing that, the storyline does indeed make sense, justifying everything that happens (or, at least, most of it) and making the ending truly satisfying. If not... The storyline could have just as easily been something along the lines of everything in this world wants to kill you and it would have affected the gameplay just the same.  Some people have found the controls to be difficult at first, though not exactly awkward. The core feature of BOD – combat – relies on the attack and block functions and combinations of movement keys that result in directional attacks and weapon-specific combos. Lack of strafe outside of combat situations is something that many have found confusing and unexpected.  To conclude the list of downsides, the games development was somewhat rushed during the last few months of production, leading to some gameplay features and parts of storyline being abandoned. Various signs of this are noticeable throughout the game, such as the presence of a different type of bow that you never get to use, the aforementioned heavily fragmented storyline and various minor bugs that may happen every now and then. There are major bugs as well, but nowadays most of them are caused by the game being pretty dated already and not always running perfectly on modern machines and modern Windows. One of the features that definitely suffered from the rushed development is multiplayer, which was left not as exciting as it could potentially be and clearly underdeveloped – nowadays, it requires a considerable amount of effort to set up a match since the game supports only LAN connections  a VPN software like Hamachi would come in handy in this case.  The game has aged fairly well and will sometimes work out of the box on a modern version of Windows like Windows 7. Players experiencing crashes, glitched fonts and such are advised to google OpenGL Raster for Blade Of Darkness – its a fan-made (as far as I know) alternative to DirectX Raster DLLs that come bundled with the game  OpenGL offers far better stability these days (the game might look a bit dark with it, so you may have to adjust the brightness and gamma additionally in the game). Occasionally, some cutscenes will not work as intended (usually resulting in the character walking in circles and other similar issues)  this can usually be solved by temporarily switching back to DirectX Raster (even if only for this one cutscene) or toggling VSync (its the swap buffers parameter in the Misc tab in the OpenGL Raster settings window). If youre having troubles with the fog being too thick to see anything in some locations, google Fog Fix (sometimes spelled FogFix) which is a minor mod that solves this problem (it doesnt affect gameplay). Lastly, just for the record, the game is locked at the 4:3 aspect ratio so if youll set up a widescreen resolution for it, everything on the screen will be simply stretched horizontally. As of early 2015, theres still no fix for this, although the developer of the ENB mod for BOD (google Blade Of Light if youre into that sort of thing) is currently experimenting with some ideas. If youre reading this review in the far future, go take a look if they succeeded. The best (though not always available) solution these days is to set a 4:3 resolution like 1440x1080 for a 1920x1080 monitor and then choose letterboxing the image instead of always forcing fullscreen stretching in the settings of your graphics card or your monitor.  Despite these flaws, Blade Of Darkness is truly unrivaled when it comes to gameplay. If you havent heard about this hidden gem and if you dont mind a game that wont let you stroll through it casually, you should definitely give it a try. These days, it can be obtained on GOG for just a few bucks. Have fun chopping up knights and orks and saving the world in the process!;5623;My first encounter with Blade Of Darkness was shortly after its release, in a somewhat shady (and most probably not quite legal) LAN game club in my area. I must have been 10 or 11 years old at the time... Needless to say, it was a fairly limited experience and I didnt really understand the game at first. It wasnt until several years later that I rediscovered it and fell in love with it. Pretty much all of the hype on the Internet about it had slowly died out by that time, but there were still active communities that I frequented.  Severance: Blade Of Darkness is one of those games that go largely unnoticed when they are released but maintain a cult following as years go buy. In Severances case, the general consensus puts the blame largely on the failed promotional campaign that left many people simply unaware that such a game even existed, and the fairly hardcore difficulty that was the source of many players initial struggles, forcing them to abandon the game. Still, Blade Of Darkness is generally considered by many people who have played it to be a one-of-a-kind, unique slasher that defines the genre. Some of the later successful games in the genre like Dark Souls feature a combat system inspired partially by Severance.  Is it perfect? No, probably not. Is it jaw-droppingly great? It sure is.;The storyline is barely present throughout the game (although the story itself is nice). Most of the story is told through intermission screens and rare cutscenes. Most of the levels are executed in a stumble upon the door – search for the key – kill bad guys in the process – repeat fashion. While all of this is justified by the storyline, you may find yourself wondering what youre doing here and what is going on.  The controls might need some accustoming to.  Multiplayer is underdeveloped and not as exciting as you might hope after beating the singleplayer campaign.  Various minor bugs throughout and signs that development was rushed in the final months, resulting in some features of the game being cut out.;6;Blade Of Darkness is all about close-quarters sword combat. The combat aspect of the game is polished to such a state that many people rightfully consider BOD to be the defining game of its genre. In terms of controls, it sort of feels like a fighting game, with blocks and combos and such, played from a third person perspective with weapons. The combat is hard, but feels very rewarding.  The graphics looked unreal in 2001 and they still look pretty impressive nowadays. It was one of the first games (if not the first one) to implement real-time volumetric shadows. A lot of the atmosphere comes from the beautiful lighting.  The music is always appropriate and subtle, fitting the mood perfectly. Sound design of the game is top notch. Definitely one of the best videogame soundtracks (such a shame that it wasnt released separately).  Great replayability.;A genre-defining combat adventure;1465;13466

As you play it you have the best nerdgasms that you ever had. The game is split into two parts: the original Super Mario Bros. with portal gun and a few of new levels that are more in style with Portal (where you have to solve puzzles too). Unfortunatelly thats not much. Also, as inovative the game might seem, it does get boring after a few hours of messing around. One thing youll notice quickly is that its harder to play with a portal gun than like in the original where you can just run and jump. Mostly because the level design of the original Super Mario Bros. isnt designed to be played with a portal gun, it has no point to be there. There are hardly any walls to put the portals on. Unfortunatelly all levels are one screen height, so the fun of falling and jumping long distances with portals isnt in this game.;8726;This game combines Super Mario Bros. on NES with Valves Portal.

1527;This game is designed as a Light Gun experience. Something like the arcades, and exactly what you would expect from that. Straight forward progress, and tons of shooting. Its only themed to be a Resident Evil game, but really is nothing more than a fun experience different from the main series. Take the game for what it is, and youll enjoy what it has to offer. Probably more so, with an actual gun.;___________________________________________________________________________________________ FIRST THINGS FIRST _________________________________________________________________________________________________ What makes a good Resident Evil game? Unrelated Characters, weird voice acting choices, and a story written by the Lisa Trevor of scripts. Good thing all of this will hit you like a ton of bricks, right from the start of the game. Trust me when I say, you will quickly know what the hell you just got yourself into. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ UNGH! MY HEAD! I TOTALLY FORGOT EVERYTHING!!! __________________________________________________________________________________________________ Yes. This is what the whole game is weighing on. From the start of you crashing your helicopter, you wake up with a headache. Sadly, you dont have any aspirin. So as a side affect, you cant remember anything.  This is the point you realize you can walk, and have this reticle to aim with...and...and HOLY S**T UNLIMITED HANDGUN AMMO!? Good thing this game is called Survivor, or I would have assumed this game was going to be easy... __________________________________________________________________________________________________ WELCOME TO THE MECHANICS __________________________________________________________________________________________________ So yea, you walk around in this stiff FPS mechanic. Where when aiming, its just an on screen reticle, you move on the locked screen, and shoot enemies with. You can walk around, but walking and turning is the same left pad. Its as amazing as it sounds. Even for the time it came out, its still awkward, and never feels fully comfortable. The game also always displays: Weapon, Ammo, Condition. I guess they knew since it would be in First Person, you couldnt really give off any indication of your condition. Good thing they got creative, and just slapped that on the screen with everything else. Oh also no chest for items/weapons. Youre a walking chest. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ HAVENT I NEVER BEEN HERE, BEFORE? __________________________________________________________________________________________________ Yea, the game never really has you backtrack. There are different ways to go about the game, when progressing forward, but nothing to send you running back and forth to unlock doors. The choices are not obvious, and kind of confuse you why you never went through that one door as you move on. Its cool though, make the right choice, and youll see some Gorilla-Hunk-Ninjas pretty early on! The game also seems to really have no puzzles. A lot of things to pick up and read, but puzzles, naaahhh. Survivors dont do puzzles __________________________________________________________________________________________________ I REMEMBER HOW TO KILL! __________________________________________________________________________________________________ For a guy who has no idea who he is, or whats going on, hes sure as hell down to kill stuff. Its what really gives Resident Evil that scary element. Especially when you pick up your Grenade Launcher off a random car hood. But honestly, they do mix in a lot of enemies from the series, into this game. Its cool to be facing against the variety, so Im a huge fan of that. Gorrilla-Hunk-Ninjas are my favorite. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ DIFFICULTY __________________________________________________________________________________________________ This game is not very difficult. If you want a challenge, youll have to create the challenge yourself (I suggest 1 handed). Because of this, the game is easy/quick to beat.

1528;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth is an experience like none other, even though it has its downsides to it, it can be overlooked by the aspects of the game that truly shines. Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth is not for the light-hearted and is possibly one of the best horror games of the early mid-2000s;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth was published by Bethesda but developed by a somewhat obscure company called Headfirst Productions. The reputation behind the game was its massive delays since 1999 as the company revised/reconstructed the game to make it what they believed was a game worthy of playing. Headfirst Productions did in fact achieve something out this, though many problem coming with it too. This game is a diamond in the rough part and the rough is hard to avoid. The game is plagued with bugs, some in the gameplay and other segments that are impossible to pass unless without a certain patch, code or even the right version of Windows (XP version) to run it. It personally left me puzzled on why the company couldnt iron out all the bugs in time but surely there were reasons. Another problem is the game hasnt aged well. The character models are quite bizarre to look at, sometimes almost alien (even normal models), the audio design is quite weak such as the gun sounds and some environmental effects.  So whats so good about such a game with many flaws? When overlooking the rough (I mentioned earlier), and seeing the diamond, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth is a fantastic experience due to how well written dialogue, characters personality, immersive and frightening it is to be embodied where it sets you in.   The story is probably the second strongest aspect of the game, you play as a detective called Jack Walters, a man with a reputation for solving crimes even if there wasnt any evidence. His character is a textbook one but is later developed more through out his witnessing of violence and horror. He is encountered by something horrific after investigating a cultic group, he is later locked up in the asylum due to terrifying event he experience with the cult, though later released from the asylum only to be called up to look for a missing person in the isolated town of Innsmouth. Venturing to the location he unravels a sinister group in which the whole town has kept a secret.   The story unravels more and more as you play as Jack, reading notes and books on the towns history shows that theres a morbid side that is very effective if youre sucked into it. The story never stops giving you more detail about whats going on, all the time the new information given about the town and its people, provides a sickening feeling that is uneasy on the mind.   Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth story isnt the best part about this game, but it is the atmosphere, that the developers made to make the world seem more believable. The world youre set in, is a dark and messy place, the design and textures of old rusted houses, factories and the sickening look of the Innsmouth people all help greatly with the unsettling atmosphere.  When utilised with the gameplay, theres a effective aspect to this. The game for the first-half, makes you powerless to fend off against enemies. You are attacked by a mob, in which you cannot do anything to defend yourself, nor can you hide, instead the only option is to run away. The game doesnt make it easy for you to do some, your enemies are fast and powerful, sometimes youll have to lock doors and bar them with anything you can find the room to buy yourself a few seconds, the game never stop making it intense. The other aspect is the gunplay which make your character though a little overpowered when fighting against certain enemies. Though this may seem like a down side to the horror  it doesnt! The game is very much Lovecraftian (well it is based on a Lovecraft lore), it implements a mental system to the game, in which traumatic experience will send your character into a paranoid and weakened psychological state. Your character will start whispering to himself and the games visuals will start to get messy and hazy. Such implementation is executed perfectly. It provides some of the best moments in the game.;2964;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth has a somewhat jaded reputation among gamers, it never was a game that was fit for the mainstream gaming market.

1529;I think that its still worth buying it.;Well, when I first played it in 1999 It was the game that changes even my taste of genre. I played it for many hours and also really enjoyed multiplayer.

1530;TL,DR  Graphic: 7/10 - Call of Duty Mod Sound: 6/10 - Buggy Gameplay: 7/10 - Call of Duty Mod Storyline: 7/10 - It was okay Effort: 10/10 - Overcome censorship, copyrights infringement, lax of funding and put out this game for $12  Overall: 7/10;Hi guys,  It maybe bias if I write the review for this game but I still feel the need of it.   - First note:   7554-Glorious Memories Revived is the very very first major game from an independence Vietnamese company calls Emobi Games. But before 7554, no one had any single idea who is Emobi Games. So when they announced 7554, everyone was so hyped that we finally make a real game, not another rip-off rubbish from any other game. The hype hit the Vietnamese internet community with tons of rumours and questions, people even thought that the game never make it because Vietnamese censorship. However, here we are, we made it after a lot of supporting for the company. So I definitely feel that it deserves my respect even if it is a potato.  - Experience:  +Pros:   Decent graphic, sounds which really did revive Indochina war from 1945 with creepy old town, rice field, jungle road and military camp. It did enough to recreate the Vietnams environment from those war days. It is really amazing that we can look at the French colonial Vietnam once again in modern time and many of those building in early part of the game still here now. Even the Metropole hotel is still a hotel nowadays. The weapon arsenal was alright I guess, it could have been much better.  +Cons:  Honestly, the graphic is definitely from Call of Duty, because they used the same engine to develop the game. It makes me first feel like I was playing a huge community mod. Some sound bugs and graphic bugs did bug me somehow, although there was no crash, I some time stuck on the top of a truck or between tree.   The AI was not that well made though, they were quiet poor. When you face them and try a meelee, they go for instant kill on you. So it was quiet weird.   Storyline was okay but it could have been done 10 times better because the plot was very potential.  + Effort: (10/10)  Emobi Games was brave to announce that their game will be sold $12 for each copy. Because in Vietnam, copyrights infringement is 98% so a lot of people will basically wait for crack which made Emobi to decide to sell their game cheaply in hope more people will buy it. However, 7554 still a total failure from them. They spent around $750.000 to make the game and they were only able to sold $50.000. They later withdrew from independence offline game and now concentrate on online MMORPG. Which I am pretty sad for that. I wish Emobi Games did not only launch the game in Vietnam but also launch it in overseas, they could maybe make some profit out of 7554.  - Conclusion:   If any major company made 7554, they would be happy if I give them a 4/10. However, I actually feel for the developer and their restless effort so I decided to give them a 7/10. If you have a spare $12 somewhere, you can go and give it a try. It is really fun.;6288;A Vietnamese who has been playing lots of game, a fan of FPS.;Graphic Gameplay Storyline Bug;6;Environment Effort  Control;A first important milestones for Vietnamese game industry;630;3241

1532;Although it has a number of graphical glitches and a rather frustrating combat system, Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines is an phenomenal role-playing game that would be at home in any gamers library.;Im going to break this down by category:  Story ------------- The story for this game, and your interactions with that story, is this games big selling point. This game comes from the age of linear RPGs, when you followed a story and you liked it. The game features a number of side missions which do an amazing job of fleshing out the world and can change how NPCs view you. This game takes place in four hubs, where you can find side quests and generally romp around, and a number of smaller areas you go to for main quests where you have more specific goals. The story is very well-grounded, especially for a game about vampires, and never tries to reach above its means. Its pretty close to perfect.  Graphics ------------- The graphics of this game arent terribly impressive, since the game is eleven years old. However, they follow a consistent and interesting aesthetic which gives flavor the the world and really brings the game to life.  There are a couple of graphical glitches Ive noticed: - The first is that, while in the sewers, the water reflections will often forget to update, meaning the water reflects the world from one point of view and you see the world from an entirely different point of view. It looks pretty weird and annoyed me a lot. - The second glitch is that objects near the top and bottom of the screen will often disappear. This includes things like parts of buildings and the ground. I suspect the developers implemented a visibility culling algorithm, so they didnt render objects that were outside of the players field of view, but theyre culling too many things. This issue amused me. - The third is more of a performance issue than a graphics issue, but its related to graphics so Ill put it here. Whenever particles appear on screen, the game experiences massive frame drops. Normally, I can run this game at 60+ frames per second. Throw in some particles, and I get like 10. No joke. This isnt too much of an issue, since there arent many particle systems in the game, but if you use some of your vampire powers in first-person mode you get this massive slowdown, and whenever supernatural enemies die they explode into particles which looks cool but, again, causes massive framerate drops. V:TM:B was built with the Source engine, which didnt have any sort of particle system until Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so I suspect whoever at Troika programmed the particle systems for this game did a pretty bad job of it.  Audio ------------ This game is from 2004, so the audio isnt super amazing high-quality noiseless recordings, but thats okay. I rather liked the way the dialogue sounded. Im not enough of an audio engineer to describe it very well, but it fits very well into this game.  The audio does have an issue that holds my rating back. When you wear headphones, it sounds a lot like the game plays the dialogue tracks separately in each ear, with one ears audio delayed slightly from the other ears. This sounds bad and hurts the overall audio quality.  Controls ----------- This is the games weakest point. Although movement feels pretty alright, combat is awful. When you click to attack, if the attack animation, enemy getting hit animation, sound of the enemy getting hit, and the number that tells you how much damage you did all occur within one second of each other, youre pretty lucky. Whats interesting is that, when enemies attack you, those things pretty much happen at the same time. Whats also interesting is that pretty much every time an enemy hits you, you stagger back, so if youre fighting a group of enemies who would be no trouble individually, theyll attack you in sequence so you stay staggered and cant do anything. Its really annoying, especially since you only sometimes stagger enemies.  I played a melee character, so I cant comment on the gun play.  Fun ----------- This game is definitely fun. The storyline is incredibly compelling, and the world makes sense in a way that few other games have accomplished. The character customization allows you to play a wide variety of character types, and leveling up certain skills unlocks dialogue options that also really help define your character. You can seduce people, then suck their blood in the middle of the street and no one cares, which amuses me to no end.;11;I played this game for the first time during the fall of 2014, after buying the game on sale on Steam. I installed the Unofficial Patch v9.2 (http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647), so consider that while reading this review.;- Particles cause massive lag - Combat is super wonky - Too many colons in the title;6;- Incredible story - Wonderful role-playing experience - Beautiful world aesthetic that permeates every parts of the game;Some inconsequential;3358;20538
1533;;I picked up on playing Tagpro in school with a couple of friends. At first I thought it was a fun little game that Id get bored of in a week or two. Quickly my entire school learned about Tagpro and we held huge games in computer labs and common spaces in our school. Soon I found out about mapmaking, Tagpro montages, and competitive Tagpro leagues. A year and a half after I joined Tagpro, here I am. I still play this game every single day, despite how simple it seems. There are no unlockables in this game. The only thing that differentiates players is how well they can predict the moves of their opponents. Tagpro also has the absolute best online community Ive ever encountered. They are welcoming to new players, willing to teach people how to play better, and there is almost never negativity (even when teams lose in major  league Tagpro playoff games). I will be playing Tagpro for a long time to come, and I hope plenty more people find out about this awesome game!;9604;;?;82;Competitive gameplay Ranking system with flair Best online community of all time;The most addicting stupid game you will ever play;3390;20805

1535;Great optimalizated gangster action at Los Santos with huge world and lot of fun.;In GTA V we are return back to Los Santos, city known of GTA: San Andreas. We are playing as 3 different characters, Michael, rich 45 years old bank robber, Franklin 20 years old gangster from Grove Street and at least Trevor, the maniac.

1536;Half-Life was the beginning of a different age of FPS gaming, it provided new features and ideas that werent done as well or before. Valve accomplished the standard the modern FPS today and its lasting impact can be seen through nearly every action game.;Half-Life though being a bit different to those who came from a different era of gaming (Post-1990s), will show many of the things that a familiar to modern FPS games. Half-Life is literally a game changer from the get-go of the game. Valve were careful in their crafting their storytelling (not their detail or depth but expression), filled with visual cues and actions, that express whats going on the games universe. In fact, Half-Lifes protagonist Gordon Freeman, is merely a pawn in a large game of chess. His character is somewhat of a odd choice. Freeman is neither the action hero nor the soldier in which previous FPS titles have been using. Freemans role as a scientist, contradicts and breaks the stereotype of action protagonists in FPS.   The action in the game is much different to previous FPS in the genre. Half-Life pushes a more cinematic style and form similar to that of films. The experience engaged in the game are: Military gun fights, disaster like events, fighting aliens and even up against special ops forces. The game make you feel like youre in an action film, similar to that of John Woo films. The action though sometimes comes to a halt as the game lets you use some brain power (puzzles segements) to pass certain areas. Half-Life perfectly accomplishes this with action. Other things like AI is brilliant for the time as well, especially with military soldiers will try to flank your position by talking to each other. Most of the human AI are never walking targets, they all want to stay alive and desperately do so.    The game is a marvel in its gameplay, though some may consider to be a bit outdated. The main flaw in the game has nothing to do with the experience provided, instead but the story. Though the story expresses itself in many ways, the game doesnt pack as much punch to be compared to any point and click adventure of the time. Though nor should it be, but with such innovations in other aspects of the game, the story seems minor and limited in detail and depth.;231;Valves very beginnings were one of success and innovation among the gaming industry. Development of the now highly praised Half-Life game, showed smatterings of ideas which didnt fully combine together. The end product though was something very different  in fact, it very much shaped the way FPS are made. Half-Life is probably one of the most influential FPS after ID Softwares Wolfenstein and DOOM series.;- Story lacks depth;6;- Engaging/Cinematic Action - Visual Expression of Story - Good AI;The Shape of FPS to Come.;2977;17434
1537;In a nutshell, those who are playing the hitman series for the first time, will get some great enjoyment out of it, for those who have played or are a fan of the series will be left disappointed by how the developers have limited their own gameplay content.;Hitman Absolution is very much at the core a Hitman game, it doesnt provide a completely different take nor does it hash out the same-old-same-old. The game is nevertheless different in which will have different reactions for audience looking for a particular gameplay. For one thing, Hitman Absolution may not be an appealing game for those who have played the games in the previous series (like myself). What has made it quite a disappointment is how they have moulded the gameplay more story focused way. This of course is not a flaw of the game, but for the Hitman series being focusing on how you execute the mission was what made the Hitman series so stimulating in the first place. IO Interactive executed this part poorly and hindered the main focus of what the game was about originally. Nevertheless the story is much more stronger than it predecessors. Again you play as Agent 47 trying to protect/save the girl from those wanting to use her for their own evil deeds. Agent 47s character is much more reflective in this game, many moments in cutscenes, shows the humanity that 47 possesses within himself. Though quite odd for the series, this brings a new perspective on 47s role as an assassin.   Gameplay-wise, nearly everything that was in the previous hitman games is in this one as well, though with more features and tweaks that were made in this one. One thing is for sure, is the assassination are still pleasurable to do and executing them in a variety of ways. Though not as much as the previous game, it still has enough to be considerable as replay value. Some of the added tweaks is the storing of multiple bodies in containers and also hiding there with them to avoid enemies. Others such as more stealth sequences and gunplay have been improved from the previous games and are much more fluid than before. The biggest downside is the disguise system. The series has often prided themselves for using disguises as a means to sneaking past the enemy and getting the end target. The developers have tacked on one of the worst features destroy another key element of the game. If using a disguise of an occupation in the area. The NPCs will detect you in a second flat. This hinders the game so much that it makes it incredibly hard, especially on more difficult missions. Though playing on easier levels will give you an instinct mode which will allow you move pass your enemies without them detecting you. Though this is problematic as well cause it always runs out too quickly and if in a situation needing to get out of and your meter is empty, good luck getting a perfect score. Its another redundant and flawed aspect to the game. Last but not least the score meter has been changed too, compared to Hitman Blood Money which gave you a list of result on how you executed you mission (I wont go into anymore detail than this), instead here its nothing more than a score meter in which killing enemies, not hiding their bodies or any sort of lethal forces minus points of your score. Not only is this annoying, but it limits how you want to play the game properly.   Graphically the game is very good looking, with much variety in the locations youre in, the detail and the texture design all are wonderful. Audio is excellent as well. Story characters are much different to the previous games, your enemies are more gross and bizarre in their own little way, with much more character behind who they are.;530;IO Interactive looks to be a decent game developer, after several years of producing different types of game for the mainstream audience, they go back to their most well-known series : Hitman. Though have similar roots to the previous Hitman games, this one is different in quite a significant way.;- Gameplay is hindered on every level. - Too linear of level design.  - Contradicts much of the role of an assassin that 47 has in the previous series.;6;+ Good graphics + More in-depth story and character development than the previous series + Enjoyable assassinations  + Fun and fleshed out villains.;Is Hitman losing its finesse?;2977;17644
1538;The overall experience of Mafia II is not a much a disappointment as it is a let down, the game after one playthrough has nothing left for it. Theres no replay value nor anything else to do with it unless you want to get collectables.;Ultimately, Mafia II tries to continues being like its original game. For one thing they are both able to establish themselves in a time period that is realistic and truthful to it. In this one, youre immersed in its culture and lingo of the 40s to 50s. It seems that 2K Czech have done above beyond job to provide a beautiful city established in two different seasons in different times. They provide a game that doesnt betray the period. As you continue into the game youll see the development from everything from cars, buildings to clothing. The game is never anachronistic to its setting. Such development is one which I appreciate the most about Mafia II compared to the original game.  Mafia IIs story is decent though not quite as dramatic or emotionally attaching as the original and even to other gangster genre games. The main characters and their personalities are diverse though and with many characters to meet which provide cut-scenes with great moments. Mafia IIs great weakness is its lack of focus on how it uses its story in the world. By this I mean the interaction in the world except specific place makes the open-world element of the game feel barren and redundant. It seems around 50-70% of the mission are designated in location which were specifically designed for the mission themselves. It doesnt help much as the world it immerses you in is quite amazing. In the previous game, though that can be similar parallels to this issue, Mafia I still provides a Free Roam mode and does use up more of its locations in the city. Mafia II provides no more replay value to its original. The games world feels wasted.   IIs gameplay though during mission is quite excellent, the gunplay is smooth and slick, similar to that of GTA IVs gunplay. Mafia II provides the weapons that fit the occupation (Gangster), it feels great to fire your weapon at the enemy. Graphically the game is technically and artistic beautiful to look at, character models though do sometimes seem a bit dated with some shoddy speaking animation, though nothing too bad.;40;The gritty and melodramatic drama of the original Mafia was undeniably a charm and a step ahead in mature storytelling. After many years, Mafia II is given the heads up in development, the original company converted to a 2K Games studio and provides us with a different experience compared to Mafia I.;- Overall wasted away world. - No free-roam - No replay value.  - Some dated character models and voice animations.;6;- Beautiful graphics that immerse you in the world. - A large variety of characters and decent. - Multiple time settings with no anachronism.  - Good Gunplay;Aint That A Kick In The Head;2977;17736
1539;Mafia is by far a masterpiece of gaming cinematic storytelling, it uses the world around you, with the gameplay and story to provide you with an unforgettable experience.;Mafia is a game which is similar to the groundbreaking GTA III but very much different in how it uses its approach to the world youre set in. Mafia is set in a era that is unexpected to the gaming world, the old-time feel the era of the 1930s. The game starts from the early 1930s near to the 40s, though the game shows an astounding amount of change, in its detail of the world and how the culture shifts from one to another. This is one of the dedicated parts to the games production. The developers show that they care more about the story and the setting its located in. The change of time after each mission will unlock a certain area that wasnt restricted before, the areas will all have different music to them, in which it helps provide an accurate look and feel of the place. The music is the classic songs of the era. Most notably the song The Mooch by the famed Jazz musician Duke Ellington. Indeed Mafias care with the setting also shows how much the story and characters are developed in this game. Mafias story is one of rags to riches and how all violence leads to many consequences. Though being a standard overview of the entire game, the detail of each mission and aspects of dialogue and storytelling is wholly unique. The game provides a world for you to look and see, without limiting it to certain locations. Though mostly the game will provide a ton of unique location specific for that mission, the games world can feel sometimes being wasted away. But not as much.  The environment and changing of years relates to the setting very well. The game provides many location where your jobs or missions have unique interaction with the environment. This is a immersive technique that is pull off masterfully.  Graphically the game is fantastic, though some textures and voice animations are sometimes a bit choppy, the game is still artistic well design, this is also thanks to the time periods that you go through and the changing of culture. The game also uses a very cinematic feel the cut-scenes and events, certainly theres an element of the melodrama genre. The gunplay is sometimes though can be left to be desired. Its still consist but sometimes a bit of an irritation to do at certain point of a mission. Another feature that is unique is how it deals with realistic car handling .The game provides different cars from different time period and how they change and handle overtime. Mission that involve car driving can provide to be quite frustrating even if it is realistic. The biggest problem with the game though is the lack of replay value for the open-world. Though the developers have provided a interesting option of free-roam and free-roam extreme to have fun and try out a few changes that theyve added in.;39;Storytelling in shooters has often been a mix-bag. Its details, characters and end-goals are often focused on the carnage and violence that it provides but never any great depth into the setting, character or world in which it places in. The world is often a place in which the game sets you in to provide the carnage and violence with no real connection to the characters or the gameplay. By the early 2000s, the release of the infamous GTA III showed that the world of a criminal has the options of explore and open world while being the anti-hero. Though another game came out a year later by a company called Illusion Softworks shows a different way of using the criminal world to good uses. The game, Mafia shows how narrative, environment and violence can be a great tool for storytelling.;- Some dated visual elements even for the time. - Realistic Car Handling can be frustrating on some missions. - Gunplay is a bit dated.;6;- Brilliant Story/Storytelling and Dialogue - Beautiful World - Realistic Car design - Good music choice;The Life of a Gangster is surely an intense one.;2977;17738
1540;Though Rogue was released alongside Unity, Rogues story was more interesting as it departed from any Assassins story weve seen in the franchise. This game is a link from Black Flag to III, then Unity, though it skipped time periods, making the game seem short. Yet the game is well done, definitely worth any AC fans 10+ hours.;The game is running a more optimized version of Black Flags engine, therefore it looks like a fully-developed mod for Black Flag which also means naval travel and battles are back, with over three regions in North America to travel across, including New York, before Connors brotherhood rose (Assassins Creed III), the North Atlantic, and the fictional River Valley. The game also reintroduces some of the characters we see in III and Unity, who were significant for the games protagonists.;7570;You play as Shay Patrick Cormac, an open-minded yet confused assassin who questioned his creed, after risking the lives of thousands for a precursor artifact.

1541;Favorite Online Multiplayer;Naughty Dog once again created a fantastic, evolving story to tell. The characters are real, gameplay is engaging and fun, and amazing graphics with seamless cut-scenes (or non-cut scenes) are cinematic. But the thing that I enjoyed the most, and I feel has been very overlooked by the gaming community, is the riveting multiplayer. Easily one of my favorite online multiplayers yet. Filled with three different game modes that are very differently played, giving the player a large variety of play styles to choose from. And the SOUND is amazing. Each gunshot, shiv kill, and snow crunching footstep fills this game with superb realism. 4 on 4 battles with other players are fun, difficult, and last the right amount of time. If a player is good they can stay alive for a while. Much better than regular online multiplayers like CoD and many others, where the main task is who sees who first. In TLoU, finding another player is running into trouble, for they are difficult to kill, and your tactics come into play immensely.;1009;This is Mikey Giambra.

1542;Supergiant literally got the same exact team from Bastion (adding four or five people to make a team of 12) and conjured up something beautiful. Transistor is chock full of detail and is a work of art through and through. The music, the actual art itself, the voice acting, it all intertwines perfectly. Every Function has a story and you have to play the game from every angle to get the full experience. It only lies shy on the core story.;Eyecandy: Supergiant Games definitely have an eye for art. Each level/area, is something to behold. It has inspiring landscapes and dream-like sunsets. The texture pallet didnt seem repetitive and every nook and cranny is filled with the utmost detail and the still frame cinematics manage to push forward the story rather than hold it back. And its all by hand too. I honestly wish I knew more about art, but if I had to try and pin it, I would say somewhere around the pastel look is how this game is. The games artist JenZee actually has a Deviantart page where you can view all of his work.  SoundDesign: The actual effects in Transistor were very nicely designed and have a good variety with each enemy and each attack. They all sounded of high quality and were believable. Although, there were moments where I was spamming a certain attack and it was the same sound effect every time and it did annoy me. But thats just a personal peeve. The voice acting was also a work of art. Logan Cunningham, who is coming back to Supergiant from doing Bastion, brought Transistor to life. He had a very smooth performance and it never sounded like he was nagging. But, the music, Oh Lord lets talk about this music. Darren Korb is now in my top 10 composers. Once again, he flawlessly executed a video game. If youre familiar with his other works youll recognize his eclectic influences all nicely wrapped into multiple tracks. If I had to guess a genre it would be something crazy insane like Digital-folk-hiphop or something. I dont know, but its all there, guitars, the beats, harps, accordions, synths, a little bit of everything. After buying the soundtrack (as I did with Bastion) its been on repeat all day. And if you liked Ashley Lynn Barrett in Bastion, then youll love her in Transistor. Darren snatched her right back into the studio and made yet another masterpiece. The overall mood of the OST is depressing, moody, dark, but  uplifting at the same time. And because theres a music filter within the game I caught myself pausing, unpausing, and Turn()ing within the game just so I could hear all the different versions of one track seamlessly transition into one another. A definite recommendation.  Gameplay: Transistor kind of has you on that off-angle-top-down-view (called Isometric). It features real time combat with a strategy based feature called Turn(). When you press the command, the battlefield freezes and you can plan out your attack according to however you see fit, and then when you hit the command again, Red goes off and executes all the moves and combos at light speed, and then you wait for it to recharge, its really cool and at times can even save your life. Now when I played this game I only died I believe, twice. But TECHNICALLY I probably died about 99kajillion times. The way death works in this game is that you have four slots for attacks called Functions. Each function has two upgrade slots that you use your other acquired functions for certain buffs. As well you can apply a Passive Upgrade to your character, for a constant battlefield effect. Now when you run out of health, you lose your functions one by one. Then when you run out of health on your last function, its game over. Supergiant is very forgiving in this game and they dont want you to die, they give every chance possible. At very few times did I feel cheated and only yelled out Bullspit! one time. But even then, one of the buildings got in the way of the borders of the battlefield. Usually when something like that happens the engine will hollow out the structure so that you can see the main character at all times. Well this game did not do that and actually caused me a death. But if you happen to be dying too much you can hit your own little personal beach house called the Sandbox and practice different moves, combos, etc. Theres doorways that lead to speed, resistance, and other challenges alike to hone your skills. And upon each mission thats completed, you unlock a piece of the soundtrack to listen to AND get granted experience so you can stay ahead of the games rising difficulty. I spent so much time there, that at one point, I did forget where I was and upon returning to Cloudbank, Transistor said, Back to reality.... If the game is too easy, you can activate whats called a Limiter to debuff the main character somehow, but the trade-off is it will give you an extra percentage on top of what you earned for every battle you win. So in a way, you choose the difficulty of the game at any time. Also when you beat it, theres a Recursion mode where you keep everything from your last playthrough and go at it again.;3022;Transistor slaps you right into the middle of things where youre immediately introduced to Red (the main character) and Transistor. Red (who used to be a renown singer/artist) and Transistor (whose origin is unknown) are on a journey to get Reds voice and Transistors body back after an orginization called the Camerata invented a robot army called the Process and basically committed a genocide on a city named Cloudbank. It starts you off in a cutscene, where the two meet each other, but somehow know each other, and then it immediately goes. Searching the city will reveal terminals where Red can communicate with Transistor and as you explore, Transistor is always talking (which never got bothersome) furthering the narrative filling in little tidbits here and there. As it unfolds though, I personally thought the pacing was a little quick. Granted, its about a 4-6 hour game depending on your playstyle, but to me it felt like it was over stuffed. If the game had an added 1-2 hours, it wouldve been solid, but thats just my opinion. Also, the relationship between Red and Transistor felt a little clichéd. The ending definitely gave a twist and surprised, but overall I liked it.;Environment would get in the way of the camera Clichéd story Felt a little over-stuffed and rushed;6;Soundtrack Artwork Leaves an everlasting effect;Transistor Written Review;1370;21934
1543;so after completing advanced rating i get my score of 42. it kinda makes sense, but somwhere else. mods pushes arma 2 in different level, when boundaries between reality and simulation blures and comes nowhere. it is serious buisness, for serious WH-geeks, no fun, such experience!;Story: arma 2 have storymode as singleplayer campaign, which i was barely interested, so after completing few missions, i forgot about it. 2/10. Graphics: static images sometimes are impressive, especially when it comes to trees and sky, but animations and overall models quality is shit, so 6/10. Audio: without mods default arma sounds are garbage. 3/10. Controls: arma way of keyboard layering is awful, it takes weeks and months to get used to it, and it is not fully rebindable, since almost every key is already binded to some action. 4/10. Fun: are you serious? arma is not about fun, it is about running 10kilometers for real few hours and getting shot in few seconds. altough it is kinda fun, when it comes to  that feels and mods, so maybe 6/10.;572;If You click advanced rating, you can pick score for five different game characteristics, which does not discribes games.

1544;Overall, theres a part of me that actually likes this game, even with its annoying flaws that plague their out it. But for some reason I came back for more and more. Its a game I wouldnt recommend to anyone who may look at the little irritations rather than the holistic picture.;Dead Island is somewhat of a flawed gem. Its by no means a bad game, but its flaws make it impossible to consider it to be ever a solid game. Dead Island for the most part, is one of many zombie horror games out there. It dumps you into a sandbox world on an island in which the undead have sprung up and started to kill innocent people. Locations of nice tropical springs, the dirty slums of the islands city and to the swampy jungles. In summary it has all the locations for you to fight zombies in and to tackle the environment at the same time.   Now when playing the game the first thing that is very much noticeable is the fact that the graphical style of the game conflict with the actual themes that theyre trying to present. Character animations and facial designs look goofy at best, with either eyes bulging out hilariously or a bleak and stiff looking faces that have no emotions to them. Sam B has to be my favourite character only because he has the goofy animations, voice acting and silly expressions on his face in every cutscene. Other graphical problems that were a bother, was the outdated feel of the game (not bad just outdated). Much of the textures look very much blotchy and low-resolution with the anti-aliasing covering it up in the worse possible way, making it look like someone had smeared vaseline all over the textures. This lessens the atmosphere greatly and doesnt feel like a serious game with serious themes.  From a story standpoint the game tries to make it seem like its a very serious game, with character talking about what horrible things have happened. Dialogue and cutscenes that were meant to be emotional though fall flat. Overall theres nothing special about it. The story was more of a turnoff and a cliche than anything else.  The meat of the game is the gameplay, choosing from one of four character with their own special abilities and skills provide more replay value to the game. The gameplay has this semi-realistic aspect to it. Every time you swing your weapon it will use some of your stamina up but also may hurt your opponent by braking it limbs. This makes every fight when encountering zombies to use your stamina wisely. Consider that, zombies in the game are not just slow walking zombies but various in their abilities. Some are generic walkers, but others are runners (infected), strong zombies (thugs) and much more. Though this does spice the gameplay up a lot, the way that the game throws them at you can be a problem.  Dying in the game can be very quick due to how many come at you. The infected are possibly the most annoying of the bunch and had led me to many deaths that are often unfair. Another problem can be the fact that your hits could be totally on target with any of their body parts but completely miss them, not taking any damage. I found moments where I was infuriated due to these problems. Other problems is how it paces some gameplay modes. If you play the character that specialises in armed weapons then over a quarter of the game (which is about 5 hours in) have you not using or finding a gun. Therere problems all across the board for this game but somehow fighting zombies and landing perfect hits are very much satisfying. Pretty much this is one of the saving points of the game.   Another pro, would be the weapons system, which has a variety of classes, types and modification which make it much more enjoyable to use. Lately it is quite a long game, it doesnt just provide you with a main story but also many side missions which can help level-up, most of them being quite enjoyable.;536;Techland had made a bit of a splash when producing a very slick and emotionally charged CGI trailer that would have several mature themes feature their zombie horror game Dead Island. Of course that was the complete opposite of what the gaming experience from the beginning to the very end.;- Zombies attacking left and right can lead to quick deaths. - Graphics look outdated - Story is generic and cant be taken seriously. - Pacing is a bit of an issue.;;- Killing Zombies is satisfying - Many weapons and variety. - Quite a lengthy game with many quests.;Serious Themes, Goofy Experience.;2977;17749
1545;Awesome game, well worth a try;Awesome game. Minigames like racing, and advancement are a must to check out after you get the hang of the dynamics.;9604;Ive played this game for over a year.

1546;TL DR: Outstanding compelling competitive gameplay, perfect balance and pure blend between competitive and casual game play. Along with an outstanding esport and dominating background.;Back when i began to play CSGO, it had everything i could imagine. Competitive and casual gameplay, a verity of game modes, and an outstanding community. However, further down the line CSGO has grown to be a huge title, and has attracted masses of fans and consumers. With a sudden inflation of players, it has impacted the CSGO community for the worse, with a serious hacker problem, scammers and just general nasty players.   Despite this, Counter Strike makes up for its pathetic excuse of a community by providing regular updates and game balances, new maps, compelling competitive gameplay and  amazing esport integration. CSGO is a very hard game to master, and required pure skill to become good  making all the better and satisfying when dominating your opponents.;1372;I first stumbled upon the Counter Strike series when a friends managed to install the original Counter Strike (1.6) to out Schools computer systems. Everyone in the class was ecstatic, and as soon as the teachers back was turned we would compete against each other. However, further down the line we eventually stopped playing Counter Strike, and after i left school i didnt touch it at all. However, a couple years later my friend recommended i picked up CSGO in a sale, not long after its release- and initially i hated, however i soon became hooked.;Hackers Poor community;6;Gameplay Balance Maps Esport;CS:GO Possibly the most superior competitive shooter to date.;901;6347
1547;TL DR: Great, exciting and very well balanced gameplay. Great graphics, awesome background and very well done story line. Definitely one of the best titles throughout the series. However poor PC port.;The game has some excellent graphics and environments. Each and every level (Arena) within the game has some great level design, and awesome backgrounds. The game (I believe) comes shipped with 13 stock playable and fightable characters that you can play both within and outside the campaign. Although this is not as many as other Mortal Kombat X titles, each and every character within X is very, very well balanced, and have 3 unique finishers. Unlike other Mortal Kombat tittles, each and every character is balanced to one another- making it fun and easy for competitive gameplay.   Outside of the campaign, the game also comes shipped with other gamemodes. These gamemodes consist of Single fight, Online fight, co-op fight, towers and more. Each and every gamemode provides a refreshing experience, especially the towers gamemode which is were you progress through the levels using a character of your choice.;7292;Let me first of stating that ive never really played a Mortal Kombat title since the Playstation 1. On that note, ive never actually played any games like Mortal Kombat since PS1.

1548;Overall, I greatly enjoyed this game. The storyline did not blow my mind, nor did the graphics-so I would not put it in my top 20, but it certainly was a highly enjoyable game that I would reccommend as a good romp into alien warfare.;The story itself was fairly typical at the outset (aliens invade planet, must fight back), but there were some very unique twists in the story which I will not reveal, which really got me thinking. I like games that make me think, so that was a pleasurable experience. The story was messy and complicated-I dont mean that to say that the story wasnt a good one, but that the story took turns that werent fairly-tale, and made the player actually feel a little sad or unhappy about the way events were going, which is a good way to make a game feel more real, despite the obviously far-fetched premis. The game mechanics is the main part of the game that really impressed me, however. I will fully admit, I am not a particularly good gamer, despite love of video games. This means that when a game has overly-complex controls and gameplay, I am often unable to keep up. When I first realized that it was a control/strategy based game, I was concerned that I would be unable to enjoy it, as I had previously experienced games that followed that structure and did not work out well. However, the command mechanics were surprisingly fluid, simple, and yet complex enough to provide a high level of strategy in the gameplay. Going into focus mode to make commands slows down time significantly, but time is still moving-which means that you still need to make quick decisions. Yet, you have time to think and plan.;244;I just finished beating this game. I play games primarily for the storyline and the fluidity in the gameplay, so if the intensity of the battle and such is more important to you, then my review wont be much help. I really enjoyed this game-I actually received it from a Humble Bundle, not as the main game that I was going for, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is my first XCOM game, so I have no idea how similar it is to others, but I found the command issuing aspect of the game to be very well executed.;Very linear mission path Restricted skills for crew Crew AI can be frustrating;6;Game Mechanics Decent Story Interesting backstory of collectables;Fun Mechanics, Good Story;808;23813
1549;I can easily say that I cant find anything negative with this game and thus making it the best game ever made. Campaign,  multiplayer, controls, soundtrack, graphics, presentation… Everything is just pure perfection. Halo: Combat Evolved is nothing but a true masterpiece and something that every gamer should experience.  Buy it! Enjoy it!;The year is 2552 and you play as a super soldier that goes by the name of Master Chief (John 117), in a world where space travel is a fact and so are alien species. While we travel trough different galaxies we encounter an alien specie  the Covenant. The Covenant are far from friendly, and during an ambush we are forced to land on an unknown planet that is formed and shaped as ring  Halo. Your mission is to save the human race and unveil the secrets of Halo…  Throughout the campaign you get to experience some truly fantastic gameplay on some just as great environments. All from sun, rain to night and day time, and everything looks just amazing. On top of that you have a great soundtrack that truly gives you shivers several times throughout the game.  Besides the campaign you have a great multiplayer as well. The variation of maps and weapons are very good, with huge out door maps for many players (Blood Gulch) and small in door maps for a more intense fight (Prisoner), and the controls are nothing but perfection. You feel as you are Master Chief just after a few fights, and there is nothing more satisfying than getting a headshot or getting a stick with the plasma grenade.;740;As much as Half-Life did for the FPS-genre in 98, Halo did in 2001.

1550;The game had some very possitive aspects that could have developed into an excellent game. Unfortunately, the designers allowed themselves to take too many liberties in enhancing the difficulty of the game. As well, many of the levels tend to drag on a little too long, especially after accomplishing a long duration of frustrating gameplay only to be met by more frustrating gameplay of the same calibre. Good concept, not well executed.;I am a big fan of the artistic content of this game. The design is whimsical and clever, with a simple yet sophisticated presentation. The concept of the mechanics are also original and clever. The protagonist (Kurt) must utilize his light beam to transport himself through various puzzles and difficulties, which is a rather unique puzzler. Unfortunately, due to the somewhat clunky mechanics and lack of accuracy in the various skills available, much of this cleverness is lost in frustration. As well, many of the platformer aspects of the game seem to be designed more to frustrate and slow down the player, rather than to enhance the enjoyment level of the game. One final dissappointment was the ending itself-after finally accomplishing the difficult game, you are greeted with pictures flashing by the screen, rather than any type of cinematic or interaction with npcs. This wouldnt have been so bad if it werent for the complete lack of music-which made the entire ending feel like an afterthought.;1892;I went into this game fairly optimistic and excited about the gameplay and the artistic style. And I wasnt dissapointed...at first. It did not take me long, however, to realize the ridiculous level of difficulty that was embedded into the game. It seemed that the programmers took great delight in bringing frustration to the player, from almost the very beginning of the game, to the ending-which I ended up repeating about 30 times before I was able to make it through.;High level of difficulty Monotony of certain levels Over-stretched levels;6;Graphics and artistic design Concepts around the puzzler mechanics Whimsical style of the story and dialogue;So Much Potential...Unrealized;808;10986
1551;Overall, this is a crossword puzzle game. But its the best crossword puzzles game you could have. Endless puzzles and other games to play.;This is the best crossword puzzle video game. The amount of crossword puzzles offered is almost endless. There are so many puzzles its overwhelming. I havent even finished all the puzzles in the EASY section. And there is still MEDIUM and HARD. As far as the questions go, it gets a bit repetitive. The same questions show up in different puzzles. And some questions are questionable. Stuff like, Vivian has two of these. and the answer (SPOILER ALERT) is VEES. You have to think really basic on most of the answers. And on the 3DS you have to draw the letter in. Which is difficult. K,H, and G are always mistaken for other letters. D always gets mistaken for an O. But I got around by drawing a lower case d. E and F get mixed up. In general it depends on what letters youre going for.  The word searches are word searches. You find words. It worked fine. And anagrams. some of those. Also it gives you a word of the day. which gives you a puzzles to do with the word. After so many words. It gives you a quiz on all the words of the days. Its fun though.;10230;This game is great.

1553;There are many great and a few bad things about this game, but to put it frankly. I would need to write a book about it to cover everything. In short: DA:I is beautiful, immersive, has a great story and really sucks you into the wonderful world of Dragon Age, but it also has bad controls on the PC, some minor bugs, and somewhat confusing mechanics.;Before I started with Inquisition I replayed the first 2 games. They both had their good and their bad points but I will not go further into this with this review. I wanted the memories of the wonderful world of Thedas freshly burned into my mind before entering an unknown chapter of the Dragon Age world. When I finally started Dragon Age Inquisition I was astonished at how beautiful everything looked. The graphics are amazing. I did notice however that BioWare learned how specular maps worked and that they placed these in every texture there was with the EA overlords in the background yelling: FLASHIER! WE NEED MORE FLASHY STUFF!.   The second thing I noticed was something that made me sad. The PC controls were terrible! In dragon age: Origins and Dragon Age II you could pause the game to select and auto attack/loot certain objects or monsters with your mouse. This function was mostly removed. They did keep the auto attack function in but it becomes very glitchy when using special attacks from the hotbar. I also had to stand on top op something lootable to even loot it. The character wouldnt automatically walk over to the item. This did bother me and I went searching for something to resolve this problem. On forums I found others who agreed with my opinion but that there was nothing to do.  I tried to resist the urge to quit and adapt to the new game mechanics. After a few hours of frustration however, I began to notice the scope of the world and the story. It was amazing. The story was exactly what I would expect from BioWare. It triumphs over the story that Skyrim has! Each land had its very distinct features. In comparison  Kirkwall from Dragon Age II seemed about half the size of the starter location. This was very refreshing to find out. I also loved the evolution of the inquisition. You could claim landmarks, recruit agents and companions etc. All to increase the influence and power of the inquisition. BioWare also removed the repetitive waves of monsters from Dragon Age II and they made almost every battle exciting even with the shortcomings of the controls.;1887;Im a huge fan of fantasy games with immersive stories like Skyrim and Dragon Age. I played Dragon age: Origins and Dragon age II a few years ago. Liked them, but I couldnt really immerse myself in the story. This could be because English isnt my first language and that I was too young to understand everything but I started again from the very start and I am astonished.;Mechanics are terrible.

1554;This game surprised me with its excellent use of video game as art. It makes you appreciate the drawings, story, and movement, while also forcing you to ask questions about the nature of choice and identity. I highly recommend it as an enjoyable and worth-while game.;Gemini Rue has a deep and thought-provoking storyline. It suggests a massive world with a beautiful back-story, while restraining itself from telling too much of that back-story, so that the game is not bogged down in needless dialogue and reading. This provides the game with a dark and mysterious feel, contributing to the overall feel of the game. The graphics, as I mentioned in my introduction, contribute a great deal to the feel of the game. This is partly, I think, because of the sophistication of the story and certain aspects of the graphics that create an appealing contrast. For example, the art style and bit-like appearance is contrasted with the amazing detail included in the game, and even the rain pouring down becomes beautiful in front of the scenes experienced.  I wont get into the story too much, but I will say that it was surprising and intriguing-this is the type of game that leaves you contemplating many different questions for weeks after you have completed it (I finished it a week ago and am still thinking about it). The main flaw in the game is that the dialogue can seemed forced at times, in an attempt to explain certain aspects of the story-even when the player has already figured it out. This is not pervasive throughout, however, and only comes up in certain scenes and transitions of the plot.;6325;I received this game as a part of a Humble Bundle, and only bothered to play it because I could use it on my tablet. I was, to be honest-not expecting to enjoy it. I have been pessimistic toward the current movement in 8-bit and retro style graphics, as I believe some indie developers use it as a method to release a game sooner, and with less difficulty. However, I believe that Gemini Rue truly made the correct artistic choice in utilizing the retro-style gameplay and graphics that they did: this is an artistic and beautifully designed game!;Some of the dialogue is a bit forced The combat is unnecessary, as it is undeveloped and plays a minor part in the game;34;Brilliant use of retro graphics Thought-provoking story Good length Not bogged down with back-story, while suggesting a rich world unexplored;This Game Convinced Me of the Merits of Retro-Graphic Choices;808;24806

1558;TL,DR  Graphic: 9.5/10 - Well made with Source Engine Sound: 9/10 - Professional and realistic Gameplay: 9.5/10 - Thrilling non-stop action Storyline: 8.5/10 - A bit simple, but it works  Online: 8/10 - The search engine in server browser need to be better  Overall: 9/10;+ First note:   In 2008 when the first Left 4 Dead was published, I was in middle school in an Asian country. When I came to the Internet-gaming shop close to school, I saw every one is playing it. Quickly dig in and enjoy the game, great co-op, great voice acting, good special zombies (Boomer, hunter, tank...), smart map, well story. I started from there. In high school, 2009, me and my buddies even created a team to go around in the city to challenge or play with other gamers and group. Although this game is not a big hit in my place, still it has many many players when it first released. So this game is not only a game for, it also a memory of our friendship and hours of non stop action, both versus and co-op.   + Experience:  Pro:  - Graphic: Great, amazing, all the zombies, maps, special infected, characters was well made. All those bloody action, the thrill of being pulled or grabbed by Hunter, Smoker or Jockey was awesome. Source Engine creates an amazing atmosphere for L4D and even better for L4D2. Cloudy sky, foggy city, dim tunnel, dark and scary sewage.....   - Characters: The best thing I think is each character can express their feeling in different situation, such as laughing, seeing a theme park, see Mid night rider, or even get ride by a Jockey, their scream and face expression is amazing.   - Sound: Very well done, all the music and sound when a horde is approaching, tank coming, special infected closing down, I feel like my body going through an adrenalin rush. Voice acting is also a huge plus.   - Game play: Good campaign, Great Co-op, Amazing Versus. When L4D first released, only Co-op was available at that time. When they updated the versus mode, and L4D2 was released, the sh*t just hit the fan. I enjoy it so much. Weapon arsenal is well done, although there is not likes hundred of choices, but every gamers can choose a weapon fit their play style: Shotgun for close combat, Sniper Rifle for range, DMR for quick sniper ,assault rifle for all purpose. Then in L4D2 melee weapons join the game. Although they are melee, each of them have different characteristic, such as katana has long range and swing very fast, machete is fast and deadly, baseball bat and cricket bat although slower but crush the enemies. Sometime, special weapon shows up such as M60, chain saw, grenade launcher, foam hand give a special twist to the game too. Along with a right amount of med kit, pills, special ammo, explosives scattering around every map, the players feel like they are well supported in L4D2.   - Special infected: The originals were good, the seconds were even better. And also with the common special infected such as the guy in the fire suit, the guy in police suit, the mud man, the clown.   - Console command: Easy to learn  - Modding: *Modding intensifies*  Cons:  The only cons I have is the online server, in Oceania or Asia, there are hardly 4,5 servers which have ping below 100 and they are all occupied most of the time. Sometime I find myself forced to leave the game because just could not find a good multiplayer server to play. And the server browser search and filter is also very limited. Even if we dont want to play some dumb mode, it shows up and it takes time to get in game and get out. It needs a better filter.   + Conclusion: Amazing game for zombie genre lover. I give it a 9 out of 10. Everything in this game is almost perfect and the modding community makes it even better. With extra maps, campaign, weapons skin, the game can be play for a long time.;124;Since the very first day of the first Left 4 Dead in 2008 until now, I believe that I have around 1000+ hour in-game.

1559;BUT, and I say but, Projekt Red has been releasing a steady stream of updates, patches, and FREE DLC every week since the games release. Its not a every couple of months update, no, theyre loyal, and they actually appreciate the gamers. It is one of the best games ever made. Every open world game, every story driven game and every RPG will be compared to this. Highest honors from Eurogamer, the very rare perfect 10 from Gamespot (only 9 games have ever gotten that honor), and raving reviews from virtually every single site you look at.  Its one of those few games that gets a 90%+ review rating on Metacritic across both critics and user reviews, and across all platforms. Its crazy that a game this hyped actually exceeds expectations. Some quests like the Bloody Baron quest line will leave you needing to put down the controller and take a walk outside. It is a triumph of story telling, player choice, character development, world atmosphere, gameplay, developer-gamer relations (100% DRM free, free DLCs, great physical copy package, etc), voice acting, visual design, music and branching plot depth, a triumph of what a game should be. A triumph that raises the bar for all of gaming. There is no other way to describe it.;The Witcher is a franchise to be taken at a slower pace than the average person might be used to. Youll constantly be fighting against the current if you try to bumrush through everything. In the beginning, it creates and introduces everything with little tutorials to help you through the first couple hours because there is a learning curve to this game. I was personally wondering how the events of the second game would effect the third and it sits you down, while getting a haircut and shave (that grows back in real time), and you actually set the game up yourself. If you didnt play the second Witcher its ok, just pick the options that most appeals to you, but for me, I picked all of the things that I did in the second and now I have to go back and play again with different options because there are HUGE chunks of game I know Im missing out on. Projekt Red does is right. A character doesnt just make a little cameo, you fight, talk, plunder, drink, and sometimes even make it to the bed with certain characters (I actually lost count of all the women I slept with). But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice , where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful, and way more interesting than most games Main Storylines. We often hear developers say how the players choices will affect the game world, but this is the second time that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true, aside from the second Witcher. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. And even when you think youre making a good decision all sorts of unforeseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a good decision you made, or re-inhabiting a town because you eradicated the bandits that raided it. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back. I honestly want to just go in and talk about every little detail about this game and how phenomenal my experience was but that would take too long. This game is honestly a staple and a standard. This game is The Ocarina of Time of the new consoles. Nothing is skimped out on, and everything has the utmost attention to detail. The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-paste that plagues todays game worlds.  There were points in the game where I was attending concerts, acting in plays, fistfighting a bear in a fight club, sailing the seas and diving for sunken treasure, betting on horse races, and kicking ass at card tournaments. There is nothing this game doesnt have. It is all there. Even the characters voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expressions are up there with LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. Youll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesnt shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex, and well made is even possible. After my 100+ hours of just ONE playthrough, there was only a couple things I nitpicked on. When riding your mount (whenever it wasnt pissing you off) and following/conversing on horseback, the characters, instead of yelling at each other because you have the distance and ambient sounds all around you (like in Red Dead Redemption), they spoke calmly to one another as if they were sitting at the fireplace. The sailing is nothing like Assassins Creed sailing, instead its geared more like driving. And the bugs. Oh Lord, the countless bugs. This game definitely needed its own can of Raid, or Orkin, or something because it was bad. It wasnt New Vegas bad, or Skyrim on PS3 bad, but there was one time where I ran into an infinite loading screen and had to restart the game. That was the worst one. No saved games lost though *cough* Dead Island *cough*;1942;The Witcher 3 has been delayed more than it needed to be.

1560;I could continue talking about this game for ages and still not do it justice. Regardless of whether you like or hate this style of game, I would strongly advise to give it a decent try.;If you are into city building games, you will find Caesar III right out of the gate addictive. At the beginning of the campaign-mode, you first have to get through a couple of tutorial-missions. After that, the scenarios slowly rise in requests and difficulty, leaving you with the choice between dangerous and peaceful cities. The longer you keep playing, the more you will have to show all your creative city designing-skills, and your logsitic skills to fulfill your citizens demands for supplies, services and products. As you progress you need to deal with crisis-situations, rising needs and imperial requests, all of which will challenge your multidimensional management skills to make all these things work together spontaneously.  Another nice thing about the game is, that the maps are big enough to allow you (in most cases) to try out different city designs what adds notably to the games replayability. In fact the game is so entertaining and provides so many options how to design and manage your city that after all these years I still get sucked into it, once I start playing.;6332;Caesar III is a citybuilder sim set in the Roman Empire and was published in 1998. I got hold of the German version in the early 2000s, when I was about 16 years old. Being a history-geek, it didnt take me long to fall in love with game. Its historical (in)accuracy, though, is by far not the only thing to love about Caesar III.;The only negative aspect of the game is how time consuming it gets. Once you advance to the more demanding missions, the play-time of a single scenario can easily exceed seven or even eight hours.;6;The music fits perfectly with the games mood and provides an ambient feeling by becoming more and more epic the bigger your city grows.;Hail Caesar!;900;6664
1561;Overall Shovel Knight is one of the best games this decade so far and will be treasured in the hearts of gamers and fans much like the original super mario bros and mega man 2 were back in the NES era.        10/10;Shovel Knight blew me away. Or should i say it dug me away. (That was an awful joke). Shovel Knight is the best game to come out of crowdfunding and it is one of the few games that actually is paying homage to the NES era whilst also being a great game. The game follows a knight. Shovel Knight. Who seeks revenge on the death of his beloved shield knight. The game takes the classic elements from old NES games and adds some of the best level design ever, a superb soundtrack and wraps it all up with charm and some pretty difficult levels. Also it has great boss battles.;7444;Hi, Im EpicEnder99;;49;Great Level Design Superb Soundtrack Great Art Style Really Good Boss Battles Tight Controls Overall Excellence;Retro Masterpiece;1750;27071
1562;Well. Its the best damn game ever made!  An overall masterclass experience. 10/10;The Last Of Us is the best game ever made. Now, hold it right there with your pitchforks. I have good reasons. And so do many other people. The Last Of Us is one the few games that actually has a deep, emotional and interesting story. Joel and Ellie are probably one of the two best written and voice acted characters in video game history. The graphics are superb and make the game feel even more real and like a movie. The gameplay is solid. The stealth is fantastic and the cover system and hand to hand combat is fantastic as well. The human enemies are some of the most common enemies in the game and they are survivors like you. Apart from they will kill you for food and dont care about anyone other than people in their group. But then there are the clickers. Theyre creepy and really scared the shit out of me at some parts in the game.   The level design is where the game gets me. The game is linear, but the way the levels were designed it makes them feel really open. There are doors you can open with shiv knives and hallways and lots of buildings to enter and search through. There are also lots of surprises and really emotional scenes that i wont spoil. The characters you meet along the way are interesting but also can be quite dangerous. There are notes left behind from survivors, telling there stories of survival. They do get quite interesting. One springs to mind. Ish. A survivor whos notes you can track down for at least an hour. It was really interesting to keep reading what happened to him, and i couldnt wait until i found another one and really know what happened to him. I was hoping at some point you meet him. But oh well.  The soundtrack is superb and i cant really say anymore about this game. Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dog did a fantastic job. I cannot give them more praise. But. There is the multiplayer. A part of the game that really did not need to be there, but it was and it was great. Fun team based multiplayer. So much content. And you can replay this game over and over, playing the game either stealthily or you can go guns blazing.  But the AI for some reason would just ignore Eliie completely. Which was slightly odd, but not game changing at all.;1009;Hi, Im EpicEnder99;AI;9;Great Level Design Beautiful Soundtrack Great Gameplay Really Good Graphics Brilliantly Written Interesting Characters;Modern Classic;1750;27072
1563;In conclusion I can only say that this game should be avoided but at the same time I feel like we all would benefit from playing it a little. It would teach us that no matter where you go in life you are going to be shat on by random encounters, incompetent NPCs and imbalanced game play, but its nostalgic and charming and nothing can compare with the joy felt and finally nailing that fucking fish you have been after since level 2.;Breath of fire is a mid 90s turn based RPG which set the scene for many aspects of RPG play that can still be seen in games today.  Much like a child born to a mother who had a healthy addiction to unhealthy crystal meth, when this game was born it had all the parts necessary for the game of the year but sadly they were all in the wrong place and not quite proportionate to the rest of the body... I mean game.   In an RPG, and especially Japanese ones, the story is all a little flip-flop and vague but it is never the less still there. BoF fits nicely into this category by giving you an epic plot within five minutes involving dragons, chosen ones and  long lost family members and immediately drops it in favor of finding a lost pig and visiting the circus for eight solid hours.  Imbalance in the leveling system twinned with the Japanese love of never ending leveling makes playing this game a bit like trying to binge-watch an anime series you know nothing about. About four hours into the game/series you start to realize that you have made a terrible mistake. Sheer boredom sets in and the only reason you dont stop is that you really want to know if the next town sells the better fishing rod so you can finally catch the fourth largest fish on the... well you get my point. Plot development is more of a rumor than a reality. And when it finally does occur you had better fucking remember the three word sentence someone un-important said in that town which is your ONLY clue where to go and will never be repeated. If you miss it, however, well fuck you. Enjoy grinding backwards and forwards between vast expanse of the maps with endless random encounters that you cant escape from, looking for the guy with an axe you need or some shit.;6337;Another hasty review of a game downloaded on a whim and played to oblivion for unknown nostalgic reasons since I never actually played this as a kid...

1564;a pretty good game with awsm graphics , controls and clear audible audio.;Unity doesnt just play well, it looks beautiful too. The graphics have a stunning painted quality to them that may be attributed to the way that different materials reacis game on your ps4 play it on your pcs as it had better enjoyment level than ps4. Not a great storyline As i had expected. Even though AC is an yearly release franchise, and to be honest AC IV is not exactly what Im looking for, I gotta say, AC Unity is freaking. so guys play it up on your windows and just lock it down!!!  t to the lighting.A huge Assassins Creed episode, with gorgeous visuals and very funny and engaging co-op missions and activities Assassin’s Creed Unity improves on the gameplay, the mechanics, the amount of people in the game and the music compared to earlier AC releases - and it even includes a fun co-op mode.

1565;This game is certainly on my top games list, and sits at the top for indie games I have played. It is a masterful work of art that should populate everyones games list.;First off, on simply the surface level this game is beautiful. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous-it is clear that the game designer really was working on a labour of love. The music is perfect for the game, and helps to add to the immersive emotional experience. The characters themselves are whimsical yet austere-they can be silly, but not in an annoying way. In particular, Fidget-the protagonists sidekick, is a delightful contrast in innocence to the world. Her experience gradually grows her character in extremely subtle yet real ways. Yet, this is often unnoticed beside the delicious character development of the protagonist himself-Dust. Dust is a warrior with an unknown past, which is gradually revealed. Even this plot usage, which can be a bit prosaic in some games, gets a marvelous face-lift.  The story is entrancing, as is the world that it takes place in. You quickly forget that you are playing a side-view platformer, and the style makes it easier to fall into the world due to the easy-to-master controls. The fighting is tight and responsive, with enough variety to make it continually interesting throughout the game. I would recommend the use of a controller (that is what I did), but a friend of mine used a keyboard and mouse and he has told me that he found the same thing. Very responsive and tight controlling. You will not die because of the controls, you will die because of your own inabilities.  The con to the game that I can see is that the boss battles become fairly simplistic once you realize that you can simply dust-storm back and forth (for the most part) until the boss dies. This, however, does not bother me a great deal, as I am more interested in story than challenge. The game does provide a challenge for those who need it, however.;2130;I am always hesitant to dive into a platformer. Partly because I am not very good at them, and partly because they can sometimes be a bit lacking in story. This game changed my entire mindset. I cant stop thinking about it-absolutely loved this game!;Boss battles may be too easy.;6;Artistic and creative graphics. Tight controls. Engaging story.;Brilliant and Beautiful;808;27762
1566;Overall, the game is great. If you like racing games. I thought I would hate it. But it was great.;I love this game. My favorite thing is the customizable cars. I love making designs and vinyl designs for my cars. Then I share them and they get pretty good reviews. Not to brag. I love the freedom of making Powerpuff Girls, XJ9, Spy vs Spy, Batman, My Little Pony, Space Invaders, and other crazy themed cars. The vinyl designs are like Call of Duty Black Ops emblems. Same style with moving and resizing shapes. The tuning and upgrades are customizable too. I just cant figure out how to do that very well. But other people do. Kind of disappointing with spoilers and other car add ons. Not very many for anything and then they all seem to lower the cars performance.  The racing style is okay. Took some getting used to. But what game doesnt have that. I havent really gotten very far in the story. I just did the minimum to unlock online free roam. Then my friends and I just race the final race and even if I lose and dont finish, I still get 66,950 CR. Which is better than the 3,000 CR one usually gets from any other race.  And the cars offered to purchase either with in game CR or DLC packs are enough. But not enough. Plenty of cars to chose from. But it would be nice if they had my car Nissan Sentra. They had other Nissan cars but no Sentra from any year. And they didnt have any Scion brands. But thats just me being picky.;7326;My friend told me to get this and I had very low expectations. But it was so much fun. I love this game.;-Car Add-Ons;49;-Custom cars.;Forzamazing!;169;28135
1567;Just when you thought the call of duty franchise was starting to get dull and repetitive they come out with this great game.;I wasnt planning on buying another call of duty for the 10th time, thinking that it would be the samething all over again. This game set the bar on single player and multiplayer pretty high for the franchise. The story was amazing, kevin Spacy killed the role of being the main antagonist. The whole future setting was great. Multiplayer was great as always, i wasnt fond of the exosuits. Overall a great game. Very first review ever sorry for being vague.;6632;;I didnt really like the exosuits in multiplayer.;12;The story for this call of duty was one of the best.

1568;Best story line i have seen for a while, its open my mind in regards to what can drive a game and keep you playing on.;After watching a few cut scenes and realizing the game play is like 60%ish quick time events I was like, “what the feck have I just spent 20 bucks on” but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and carried on for a bit, I am glad I did.  I have all ways been a  bit of a sucker for a lead female role with supernatural powers but the story line really did captivate me.  Not giving the story line away here, but hope you have a look for your self . I was emotionally stimulated by it, which other than getting fired up is rare for me it a game.;1342;I am your mom, (or not).

1569;A bit of a let down but I have high hope for fallout 4, whoop whoop. Also why is there not an exit conversation button, like in the loot screen?;One of the first things that struck me was that the main character must have really short legs due to how slow you walk and when walking through the waste land I really noticed it.  The biggest let downs for me was the fraction system,  at first glance it seams great,  over time a few things seam a bit of , the most annoying is that after interacting with a friendly NPC if you change to an oppositions fractions armor (which disguise you), they will indiscriminately open fire, even after you have taken it of. On the other hand a fraction you have bad karma with, will gun you down form a distance even if you are in a disguise.  The main story line felt to me as a string of side missions rater then a main story line fleshed out with side quests.;16;Really enjoyed fallout 3 and was like here we go again.;glitchy at times incomplete  game mechanics;6;addictive loot and leveling up nice world creation, lore;I have not completed it, but feels half baked.;3687;28788
1570;Little bit of a fan boy so this is a far from impartial review, but basically one of the best games I have ever played. Not sure what the highest point was, but its either challenge mode and trying to get all platinum cups or playing the customizable arcade mode with a friend.;Spent hours play in the arcade and challenge mode, priceless repeatability. Really enjoyed the storyline with different playable characters, set though out time.

1571;Overall, this game is probably one of the better Mario games out there. Lots fun to play and create.;This game is great. I got it when it was released. I personally love games where I get to create things. However, even though I got to. I had to unlock all the parts. The way to unlock the pieces was lame. You have to wait. Not sure if it was because of it being new. Or if it has changed. I dont know. But once you get all the pieces or not even having all the pieces. I can make some really good levels and upload lots of challenging ones. I made a maze level that is a huge hit.  Its great making a level and checking out later that 216 people played it. Commenting on it and giving it stars. Even if they hate it. Its still getting the word out that this level is fun.  As far as laying levels goes. Im enjoying it way more than I expected. 100-Man Mario thing is great. Playing level after level. And skipping the ones that are just too crazy to complete. You have to complete your level to upload it. Which is fair. And having the music play over everything is great. My Xbox friends playing Evolve with Mario Theme playing over it. Ruins the scary aspect of their game meanwhile Im cursing trying to get over a mountain of Goombas and Koopas.;7339;This game is great.

1572;Overall, this game is fun if you like Animal Crossing. Different from the standard game. But still worth trying out.;The bases of the game is that youre new at town. But now you just work at Nooks Homes designing the inside of homes and businesses. The controls are very good. Very easy to learn. Nice flow of gameplay. There is a story to it. Its more finishable than the standard Animal Crossing games. But Im going to spoil the really not that bad spoilers. Helping Isabelles requests were more interest for me. Concert halls and hospitals are more interesting to design than some guys black and white themed house. But houses still have their fun. I didnt really like the outdoor designing. You can design characters yards. But other than trees, bushes, and flowers. Wish there was more to do with it. And as far as difficulty goes. As long as you use the requested pieces, you can make the room look awful. The NPCs dont care. I just like making it look nice.   The Amiibo cards. If you get the game new. You get an amiibo card. Not too much it does. If you go into a place you designed, you can use the amiibo card and have that character walk around the place.   Sounds were good. Clear and catchy tunes. Graphics were great. Nothing to really take away from the game.;10143;This game wasnt that bad. It was fun if you like this sort of thing.;-Yards;37;-Fun;Happy Town Designer;169;32251
1573;Its fun and everyone should give it a shot.;This game is pretty sweet. I like the boss battles, the weapons, the zero gravity sequences, the science fiction ideas behind it. To me this game reminds Resident Evil 4 more than anything else (maybe other Resident Evil games as well, I dont know). You have little ammo, you can save progress only in save points (though they are frequent), you mostly fight slow moving zombie-like mutants and giant bosses. There are many more similarities. Basically, its Resident Evil 4 in space. And its very atmospheric too.;37;I tried this game once but couldnt get over the camera which is positioned in such a way that Isaac covers half of the screen. But then I played Resident Evil 4 and I got used to that kind of perspective. So I gave Dead Space another try and it was a blast. Great fun and awesome science fiction.;;6;;This game is pretty sweet;854;32643
1574;CONCLUSION: I had to force myself to finish this game. I dont want to call it bad, but at the sametime I dont want to use the word good as a replacement. Mad Max is very alright. It was an array of features that wasnt well executed. It seemed like Avalanche Studios was trying to find a balance between their style of gaming (Just Cause) and Warner Brothers formula for games, and they ALMOST had it. A lot doesnt make sense within this game, and if I was to recommend an open world RPG in this respect, I would recommend Shadow of Mordor.;EYECANDY: The landscape in Mad Max is wonderful. A beautifully crafted wasteland that feels vast and empty. The particle effects (smoke, dust, fire, etc.) are nothing short of professional and was probably the best looking part of the game. Each enemy camp, cave, blown up gas station, underground cavern are all unique and you wont notice any repeating interiors. A lot of crafting and detail went into the areas of exploration and it shows. This is easily the best part of the game, the visuals.  SOUNDDESIGN: Sad to say though theres nothing too special too denote here. The explosions are really the only thing that is hi-fi in this game, or as far as sound goes, stood out and somewhat made you feel it. The soundtrack was a sub-par score. No melodies that get stuck in your head, no catchy tunes to hum along to, just background noise. But Ill give the voice actors some credit. While you meet wildly different characters, none of them stand out. I think its because theyre all far too left field. Each main character is quirky and crazy in their own right, but in a way caused them all to blend together. But what was really cool was when during the most important cutscenes in the game the audio didnt match up with the video. Not like it mattered because the SFX sucked anyways, but thats just another tick that takes away from the experience.  GAMEPLAY: Now in this game, there is a lot to do. The wasteland is very big, which is also its drawback. Its too big, and going from one place to another, collecting scrap for your upgrades, and destroying enemy camps to lower the threat level in allied territory feels more like a chore. Kind of like when your parents would tell you to clean your room. It wasnt fun and you only did it because you had to. There is a lot of mechanics to be had in this game though. Mad Max is all about the cars, and in this game, there are a multiple of cars you can collect, fight, customize, everything. But what I dont get is why in the world would you have the main mechanic in your game be broken and wonky as hell. The driving in Mad Max is atrocious. From the seizure-like camera to the street mechanics themselves. You will find yourself constantly doing flips and turns and making bad turns and sharp corners, running into walls and off cliffs and pretty much anything else that constitutes bad driving (refer to the hallway car scene in the first Austin Powers). There was more than one mission that was all vehicle based (not counting the race side missions) and I wanted to quit the game. I say it all the time: There is a very big difference between challenging, and frustrating, and the driving in Mad Max is VERY frustrating. Then theres the leveling system. You level up Max to earn new abilities, gear, skills, etc. But then theres some weird prophet guy that reminds me of the happy mask salesman from Majoras Mask where you can level up Max again. So its like you level up Max to level him up again. Its a strange concept. And the fighting is only fun when it works. I know I wasnt the only one because I brought it up with other people and they said they had the same problems but throughout the whole entire game the engine refuses to read your input and you will die because of unfair mechanics. Warner Brothers has their game formula. A big map with multiple vantage points, and you do stuff within said area.;2552;Mad Max holds a minimalist type story. Ill give it to you in one sentence. Max has a past hes trying to escape from, and he needs to build a car with a V8 engine to cross the Plains of Silence. Which is unexplained (or at least it wasnt made clear to me why he wanted to do that) and the only way to do that is with his faithful companion named Chumbucket who is a mechanical prodigy and wears a spark plug necklace, looks like the hunchback from 300, pesters you like the fairies in Zelda, and talks like Smeagol. The game then attempts to fill in the world and backstory a little bit by collecting what is called History Relics and theyre just pictures with captions The Last of Us style and Max gives a little line of dialogue with each one thats found but theres barely any motivation or interest to collect them or find out the history so it feels like filler. But I will say that I thought Max was an awesome character. Hes that cold-hearted and ruthless type that cares about nobody but himself which mixed things up from the casual hero type but did lead to some confusion at the end of the story which was horrible and anti-climactic. Mad Max has an awful ending to its extremely short and (arguably) eight hour campaign.;Camera is Atrocious Driving is Wonky Hand to Hand Combat is Broken;49;Beautiful Landscape Decent Characters and Voice Acting;Mad Max Written Review;1370;32886
1575;A mature and fun vampire game which is an unique experience, from its quirky NPC right down to its clunky character control.;The bad: This was a very buggy game, I hear it has been fixed by the online community, although considering everything I had to go trough to play trough it back in the days, I have a bit of mixed feelings about how much you can actually fix.   Melee fighting system is clunky and clumsy, aiming with ranged is just clumsy, which in its way pushes you to play the role-playing part of the game much more, rather than just strong-arming trough it.  The good: That aside, the game is unique, in that it is one of the rare games that takes vampires a bit more seriously (I guess its like Twilight made by Goths). This can be attributed to its source material, the Not-C-Rpg vampire franchise of the same name, so I cant credit the developers for it, although their execution is good.   The story is fabulous and dark and very mature, the soundtrack is great, the characters inhabiting the world are well built, well voiced, well written and all in all a better experience than most TV shows. The golden word here is IMMERSION!;11;I am a long time gamer and visual artist, and have spent lots of time with RPGs in my life.;-Buggy -Clumsy character control;6;-Good Story -Great Art -Good Voice Acting -Mature and funny content;Flawed, but unique.;886;33314
1576;A hand-drawn interactive childrens book, just much better. Even if you hate this type of game, the art and game world will keep you hooked.;This game is a perfect puzzle point-and-click game for an introduction to the genre. It has intuitive puzzles which fit organically into the game world. No meta-gaming needed nor special references, its all in there, in the game world and in the story. If you follow it closely, the puzzles make sense and add to the immersion as much as its great art style. But, very often you need to try different steps in different order so you can find the right one that solves the puzzle. Having to watch the same animation... agAin and Again...and aGain and agaIn... just to find that agaiN is the right one gets boring fast. This is perfect for children trough  adding an option to jump or speed up animation a lot more would be great.;2990;I am a long time gamer and visual artist.;-Lacks game options;6;-Art -Sound;A hand-drawn interactive childrens book, just much better.;886;33315
1578;Halo 5 Guardians is a professional game with faults that shouldnt be holding the game back and can be considered rookie mistakes. But all in all, everything one should expect from Halo is there. Immersive story, excellent score, phenomenal actors, addicting multiplayer, character customization, and worth every dollar. If the AI was polished then it would be a top notch in my book.;EYECANDY - The visuals are astounding. There were no texture loading issues, lo-res sections of the map, and care and detail went into all of the environments and models. Halo takes you to different worlds throughout the galaxy and they all feel organic, refreshing, and genuine. All artifacts and landscapes have their own history, fauna, civilization, and at some points was even amazed. This game has moments where you want to stop and take in the scenery and search around the level (because if you know Halo then you know about the skulls and intel). I was truly impressed with what 343 came up with. Once again, only two complaints: One, which is pretty minor, there were sections of the game with water and when you crouch beneath it theres no water effects, the game just becomes clear instead of murky, or blue, or whatever, but it doesnt actually take away from the game. Two, the animations of characters in the distance end up coming off really choppy. At first I thought it was the framerate, but then realized it was how the engine handles in-game events. It looks weird and takes away from the fluidity of the game. But other than those, this game is B-E-A-UTIFUL.  SOUNDDESIGN - This is easily one of the best part of Halo. As far as sound design goes, I put it right up there with Battlefield and The Witcher. At first I had it coming through my TV speakers and it sounded fine. Nothing great, but not lacking. Then I put on my Astro headset, changed the sound option to headphones, and it elevated the game to a whole new level. Each team members footsteps are differentiating, you can hear the individual breathing of the characters and covenant when you get close, the list goes on. The effects are high quality, all weapons sound realistic and authentic (even the fictionalized ones), and it never blended all together as one muddy blah in the background when the game or cutscenes got really intense *coughcough*CallofDuty*coughcough* but actually became more immersive the louder I turned the volume up. And the soundtrack is top notch and mixed excellently with all the chaos, yelling, and explosions. The game has three-dimensional sound and you can tell whos far off, whos next to you, what weapons the enemy is using, everything. The main menus title theme holds plenty of texture and sounds are full and satisfying with a hint of nostalgia, while the battle music amps up every conflict and makes all firefights intense. This is a soundtrack I will purchase. I just wish during the quiet and ambient parts of the game there was a little more melody to give the worlds and environment just a little bit more culture, but honestly thats just a personal preference of mine. Not one complaint in this department. Everything is absolutely perfect.   GAMEPLAY - As far as a FPS goes, theres not much to talk about. The story was on the shorter side, BUT there were parts that were straight pissing me off. I played through the campaign on Heroic (hard) difficulty because the game said that for Halo veterans, this difficulty is the best one. So I chose it and launched myself in. Halo puts you through the game with squad members, four in total including yourself. And it aint no Ghost Recon or anything, but you can command your squad to go places, focus on enemies, or pick you up when you fall down. But lets take a moment to talk about this AI real quick. Something that Halo as a franchise has always put emphasis on. They utilize the feature horribly. Your teammates are awful companions and are too smart for their own good which ends up hurting you in the end. What I noticed 343 tried to do was to make your squad tactical, but it leads to a lot of frustration. When the team is told to focus on a certain enemy, only one will focus on said enemy and the guy even told me, and I quote, As soon as I kill this soldier, Ill get to him. Um, no, Im your commander, Im your leader, and you do as I say. If I tell you to focus on this enemy because I need some cover fire, then you put your attention on that enemy. If I need suppression so I can flank this turret, then thats what you do. If this were real life, that would be completely understandable. But its not. And they put in a new feature where instead of dying, you have about 15-20 seconds for a member of your squad to make it you and pick you back up before you actually die. Its so you can get a second chance (you can be dropped infinite times) and keep the momentum and the fight going. BUT a lot of this game was spent waiting for my team and reloading from the last checkpoint because my teammates barely ever revived me. Never mind the countless times I picked them up, they would either be a couple tens of yards away (all three of them) for whatever reason, or they would stand about four feet away from me and watch me bleed out. Just stand there and watch me die. And of course theres no suicide option so you HAVE to wait for them to get you. And the driving, oh Lord the driving, is the worst part of their brain. I sat on the back of a mongoose for a solid half minute while my partner just chose to not drive anywhere. But its a good thing they didnt because when they did drive somewhere they were too busy flipping over and running into walls Austin Power-ing themselves while we get shot at and blown up. This is the worst team AI in the Halo series and it was a serious step backwards. But enough about that. The actual missions themselves vary in length and hold a lot of nice variety to keep the game fresh and interesting. Halo has been an open world-esque type of shooter and it plays in nicely and is definitely a good change of pace than the usual go-here-shoot-follow-this-npc formula. The stupidest, and shortest, mission though is when youre at a friendly camp and you have to eavesdrop on people. It was very strange and horribly executed. Other than that, Every gun has a zoom type option, when you jump and aim in mid air, the spartan actually stabilizes himself for a couple seconds so you float and can pull off a couple headshots, but the side to side sway is really slow and cant be edited in the options menu even when the sensitivity is set to a higher amount. Ive died from the simple fact that I couldnt turn to shoot the enemy. I couldnt figure out why it played like that, but it did.  MULTIPLAYER - Arguably the only reason why Halo ever got to be so popular was because of its competitive aspect. The company took a little bit of a different take on it and split it into two sections. Arena and Warzone. Arena is the traditional 4v4 Slayer, Swat, the classic halo multiplayer. Warzone is a big team battle where it melds a lot of what other games did. First off, the type I found the most fun was its Warzone mode where it was team against team, with AI enemies included. It consisted of a Battlefront/field type where you take control of certain command points, and at the end destroy the enemies home base all while killing the Prometheans and Covenant for extra points to win. I experienced very little lag (I think it was me in all honesty) and even when I lost I wanted to keep playing. At the end of each match you gain your experience, and get REQ cards. Their earned when you rank up, or when you buy them. Theres three different types of packs, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Which can be bought with the points that are earned in every game, or with an actual credit card transaction. Within the packs are special weapons, boosts, armor upgrades, etc. What it reminded me of was Mass Effects special packs, Titanfalls cards, and Advanced Warfares feature where you earn outfit customizations and experience boosts. Overall its a whole separate experience from the campaign and its still a hell of a lot of fun.;6803;Halo 5 deals with two main characters this time around. Good ol Master Chief with his Blue Team and John Locke, leader of Team Osiris. And its pretty good. The campaign itself is pretty short, probably about ten hours, if not less. But theres a lot of quality to be had in this game. The pacing felt a little rushed towards the end, but this was the first time Ive played a Halo game (and Ive played them all) and was actually INTO the story and felt immersed. 343 Industries tries to fill you in on everyones role and why now youre playing with a team of spartans instead of going solo like previous installments, and you come to learn how deep the story is and how alive these characters actually are. Only two complaints with the story: One, there wasnt enough of it. Two, while executed fairly well, the ending was predictable and cliched.;Atrocious AI Odd Post Processing Effects Short and Predictable Campaign Slow side-to-side sway;49;Immersive Story Phenomenal Score Addictive Multiplayer Incredible Sound Design Great Variety between Campaign Missions;Halo 5: Guardians Written Review;1370;33893
1579;Great game, so far the best in the series with beautiful graphics, and fantastic musical score and the many options that we got to love in the anno series.;I remember playing anno 1602 when i was just 9, hell, it was a difficult game! The series has grown alot, the latest installment anno 2070 dissappointed many.  Anno 1404 has alot of good things going for it. The game is way more accessible to newcomers with a simplified UI, but hidden behind the simple UI there are still the many advanced options that we are used to from previous titles!  Besides that, the multiplayer that was shipped with the venice expansion is more then welcome. This is one of the best multiplayer games ever if you just want to relax an evening and play with some friends, establish beautiful cities, trading routes and eventually wage war!  By far, for anyone wanting to get into the anno series, albeit a little bit of a steep learning curve compared to other games, this one is the best! Forget about anno 2070, put your money on this one until a better installment comes along!;8227;A long time fan of the anno series!;-Simplified UI;6;-Great graphics -MP support that even allows coop control of the same city -Great musical score;Anno 1404, the best in the series!;407;34227
1580;At the end of the day this game is just more Rock Band. I could spend all day tearing this game apart, but if the game does exactly as what it advertise can I really blame it. Besides Harmonix is planning to release new updates over time with the first update coming around the corner. One the plan updates is variable breakneck speed which would be nice. So for now if you have working instruments I recommend staying on Rock Band 3 until the game is feature heavy. Otherwise Rock Band 4 is solid update and it’s here to stay.;With Rock Band 4, Harmonix decided to concentrate on what made Rock Band what it was today. They wanted to go back to what Rock Band was all about. Jamming out to your favorite songs, old and new. At its roots it’s still your basic Rock Band game  notes coming down a highway and hitting them with succession. The biggest feature is the addition of freestyle solos. Instead of individual notes during a solo section, it is replaced by lines that the appear on a certain beat. Here you can press the frets anyway you want. Only thing you are required is to hit the strum bar to pace they set.   They also revamped the option to play a set list, instead you pick the initial song and once you finish the song a list of new ones come up and you vote on the next one. Along with the option to drop in and out of songs and change difficulties on the fly, it keeps the party momentum going. The downside this is they removed the option to just pick the whole set list you would like to play from the start.  Tour mode is back but it feels more like a downgrade with the removal of the loading animations. You know, the ones where your band is shown riding a limo or doing a sound check. While you still have the choices after every section of the tour. It feels more like a “Choose your next bonus” instead of feeling like a choose your own adventure. They do however cause little quirks at the end of the tour like having to shave your hair since you contracted lice from a fan’s bird.  Certain features are not in the game at all like online multiplayer, practice mode, and a robust character creation system. Two of these are really big omissions. Harmonix did however ensured they are listening to the fans and updates are coming. This is what makes Rock Band 4 interesting. It will be the last Rock Band game to be released. Because of this they are going to continue to support RB4 with updates and new features well into the future. Sounds like they want to avoid flooding the market with plastic instruments again.  Speaking of which they got rid of Pro Guitar, and the keytar entirely. While this is a huge blow to those that invested in those instruments. According to Harmonix, they surveyed many Rock Band fans and found out many did not really care for those instruments.  Luckily for me they decided to stick with Pro Drums since the support for it has been built in since Rock Band 1. That being said, Harmonix tried to support as many legacy instruments as they could. They included every single wireless rock band instrument including RB1. They also managed to support most Guitar Hero guitars including some early ones, which is a nice bonus. With this you would be able to purchase any of the two standalone versions and continue rocking out. Madcatz did release updated instruments alongside with the game as well. You can tell they put some thought into them to make sure they would last. The pads on the drums feel like a tougher rubber. The neck on guitar feels less “plasticky.” They also included the option to update the firmware just in case some issues do arise.  The on disc songs are somewhat lackluster but some big names are here like Bruno Mars’s Uptown Funk and ever popular Panama by Van Halen. This fault is overshadowed by the fact the 1500+ legacy DLC library was updated and ported to the next gen consoles. A feat that sounded impossible, so I give Harmonix a round of applause for that. Another commendable act on their part is that you would be able to re-download every song you have purchased in older versions of Rock Band free of charge for this new game. As for those newcomers to the series, having access to such a robust song library with so many varying styles will please any fan. The price for each song did however increase to $1.99, but this is due in part adding freestyle solos to every song in the library.;10128;After what felt like an eternity (alongside the fact that my instruments practically broke down from constant usage), being able to play really had me hyped. But how come after playing through every single of my songs do I still feel empty. It can’t be loneliness because it is still at the forefront of many house parties. Could it be the song library? It can’t be that either since at launch they ported over at least 1500 previous DLC they released. Then what can it be? Oh, it’s the fact that the game itself is empty.;No Online, Practice Mode. Weak character creation. Lackluster Story.;48;More Rock Band!! New and updated instruments. Van Halen!!!;Become the Rock Legend you dream of with Rock Band 4!;4243;34361
1581;With a few issues here and there, this game is still fun to play. The voice commands are pretty good, with the ability to make your own commands. The story is not the best but still able to keep you interested. And characters that somehow keep you intrigued even though some are just boring. As a little bonus they included what is meant to be used as a Training mode but can be doubled as a Horde Mode. It’s not a bad place to test your might. With this in mind you should still keep this game in mind. Also at the time of this review the game sits at 14.99 on steam, so it’s not a bad game for that price.;You will be manning the character named Sam, an awesome strategist who aids Val (Voiced by Ashly Bruch) in saving Corrin (Voiced by Wil Wheaton), a dull developer by day but a brilliant cryptographer by night, from being abducted. Along Corrin’s quest for the truth he comes across several characters. While some are awesome and witty *coughAdamcough*, and others who are just plain dull, Miranda, there’s enough voice acting to go around.  Every single dialog in this game is fully voice but sadly it’s accompanied by stiff moving animations. If only the models moved a little better you would be able to feel the emotions of the characters. With easter eggs sprinkled here and there and an interesting plot twist, which I had to read up on it online to understand it, it makes the story somewhat enjoyable.  The world that accompanies this story is probably not the most appeasing. Every corridor in the game looks similar but in a different shade of dark. Makes you wonder if the future really is going to be all about dark colors. Most if not all levels are different combinations of big rooms or small corridors with places to cover. This is where each battle begins to get a tad repetitive. With no real variation in areas, they might as well made the entire game horde mode.  Which brings me into the controls.  The last voice controlled game I played was almost 10 years ago. So coming into this game I had high hopes that the tech has advanced far enough to make using it enjoyable. It still has its bugs here and there but it is still usable. Iridium Studios tries to alleviate the ailments by giving you the option to rename almost all of the voice commands. They give you a few default alternatives and some of them are funny like, “Party at Foxtrot 4.” But sometimes the issue is not with the commands. The game wont outright register you if you start to get flustered when the enemies are doing some heavy damage. I ended up having to speak like a caveman to ensure I would keep calm and have the game register me. When its working the game is quite fun to control. Makes me feel like a dictator and the game characters are my peons. It would have been nice to have better keyboard and mouse controls, but in doing so would kind of ruin the story of the game.  This games soundtrack is quite enjoyable. With some awesome guitar riffs and synths, the game feels more like future you would find in an 80’s movie.  The soundtrack is composed by Big Giant Circles (Jimmy Kinson) and Ronald Jenkees. If you have listen their work before you would instantly feel at home.;14415;Voice Commands in games have gained a bad rep over the years. The concept is sound, but the execution is the problem. Till this day voice commands are hard to perfect. So making a game entirely controlled by it is a challenge Iridium Studios was willing to take. Headlined by an amazing voice cast only to be hindered by dull characters, level design that is subpar, and game length that leaves you asking for more, you question if the 15 dollar price tag is worth it.;Voice control learning curve. Stiff Animations. Dull and repetitive environments.;6;Awesome Soundtrack. Complete Voice Acting.;If a voice command fails, does it still make an echo?;4243;34405
1582;An overall look at the game and I can certainly say that I had a good experience with Guns, Gore and Cannoli. I wish though it was a little longer which hinders it from having more good times blasting zombies Italian mob style but sometimes that doesnt happen.;Guns, Gore and Cannoli is a side-scroller shooter set in the misery soaked prohibition years of the 1920s. You play as Vinnie Cannoli, an enforcer for a mob boss who desires a man by the name of Frankie that resides in Thugtown, considerably a hostile area. Narration provides us with a sort of semi-mystery to the plot, as the people of Thugtown are becoming zombies for some unknown reason and Vinnie only tasked with bringing back someone to his mob boss gets stuck in the teeth of the undead.   The story presented in the game is nothing more than something to drive the gameplay. Detail and depth in this storyline are barely there, with very little interest in pushing anything meaningful, the story is never told in the gameplay and is limited to cutscene which hold not value or depth. This can be considered understandable as the games whole reasons for its existence is to blow up zombies in the 1920s-era.  The story aside, the gameplay which is the main focus of the entire game is worthy of merit. The game has you blasting away at zombies non-stop with 1920s guns and a few other weapons that are somewhat science fiction-like but still fit in due to the non-nonsensical nature of the game. Gunplay provides satisfaction as the game provides much of the gore goodness to come out of the both genres, I never would have expected such enjoyment in using a Tommy Gun in disposing my enemies. Though therere some downsides to the gameplay, that is that the featured variation of zombies to be found can be quiet annoying and a unfair disadvantage on the player at some moments of the game. Other enemies (rats for example) found in the game also have similar annoyance due to the size and the amount of time it takes to unload the unnecessary amount of bullet into them to be killed. Though one can consider this a little bit of a nick-pick on my part, these moments I felt were unsatisfactory.   Graphically speaking the game has some very good looking appeal to it. The hand drawn design of the world and animations have a charm to them that cant be replicated in 3D games. The sense of the 1920s feel is perfectly captured. Audio also has a role to play in this game, though somewhat overlooked in areas (this would include music), the music in the game has the aesthetic appealing to that of the 1920s though over a period of time, it becomes very much a chore to listen to it while playing the game and becomes sort of uneven with dramatic moment in the game. Other elements of the audio production though were reasonably good. The voice actor have that cliché gangster tone or the sort of New York accent, all of which were good fun hearing during game.    Lastly, I have to mention was the game was unfortunately unnecessarily short which did disappoint me, clocking around 3 hours to finish it normal with multiple deaths on occasion.;13187;The mass amount of zombie games are similar to that of world war II games. Theres tons of them and nearly each brand has some sort of variation to them to make them either humorous or more appealing to the next. Who would have thought though that such variation would lead to mix of classic mob violence with that of the hordes of the undead. Guns, Gore and Cannoli perfectly represents the mix of the two genres (gangster and zombies).;- Bare bones story - Uninteresting music - Very short game;6;- Gunplay was good - Voice acting was amusing - Sometimes very wacky;Thats some Good Cannoli;2977;34406
1583;To summarise, this could be the best game ever made - and in my opinion it probably is. Certainly the best game ever produced for the playstation.;Final Fantasy VII is a masterpiece. It is the one game against which all other games in the final fantasy franchise are measured against. It combines a brilliant, intricate plot and memorable characters with a simple, repeatable play mechanism. At times final fantasy VII is compelling, addictive and frustrating in equal measure.  The weapons and materia system is easy to use and battles are easy to navigate through - which then leaves more room to develop the main game itself - of which there is at least 6o+ hours of playable time. The game is open-ended to a degree, as is there is a set path but nearer the end of the game there are obstacles which may not be need completed in a set order, and some which may be missed completely. The bosses are memorable, the limit breaks are great too and even trying to get a gold chocobo is actually quite fun! Training up your team is also very addictive.   The one downside if any, about FFVII is the graphics. Good for 1997 but havent aged well. The cut-scenes are still reasonably good, but some of the other graphics are dated. If square were to decide to do a re-make of this game with todays graphics I think everyone would buy it.;427;I remember playing this game on the playstation when I was a lot younger at a friends but did never truly appreciate it.   Years later I bought it on ebay to play on my ps2 and it was only then that I really got into the game and pretty much got addicted to playing it. I now have the game through the playstation store on my ps3.;Graphics are now a bit dated,;7;Plot, characters, longevity of the game, easy to pick up controls etc;Best game ever made?;4302;35030
1584;Overall, Its a fantastic game. Certainly worth playing.;I loved this game. The story was great. Lots of drama and deep emotional events that really drove the game forward. Im not going to spoil too much.  The gameplay was great. Everything worked smoothly. It froze on me once. But then unfroze. Ive never seen a game unfreeze. I love the obstacles. Climbing and jumping through crumbling landscapes.  Graphics are improved of coarse. Lara Crofts face changed. Not bad or weird. Its just animated different from the first game. But everything else is great. The graphics are clear.;7323;This game is great. It was just as much fun as the first game. Or first remake of the kickstart of the franchise. Great story, graphics, and new abilities.;;49;-Great Story -Good graphics -Fun obstacles;Fantastic!;169;35604
1585;Fantastic game with good to fairly good 3D playability.;In earlier years 3D worked really well but these days developers (devs) have made the environments far more real by adding shadows and other effects. These effects cause problems like artefacts and uneven plane rendering. The first Tomb raider that ever played in 3D was TROAD or Tomb raider Angel of Darkness and it worked perfectly in 3D. The first ever game played by this reviewer was Half-life and that works brilliantly in 3D as does the rest of the franchise. For future reference the system being used is NVidia nVision. up until recently it was necessary to use glasses and a separate receiver but now you can purchase a monitor that is equipped with 120 Hz refresh rate and built-in 3D receiver. The advantage of the newer screen is that the entire game plays in almost perfect light. You see -  because 3D shutter glasses tend to shut the light out on every second frame your view is usually quite dark but the new system seems to have fixed that problem. Far Cry 4 works well in 3D but not perfectly. In earlier 3D shooters your gun would actually extend out from the screen to your keyboard depending on how high you have convergence set. For some reason the stock of your gun in FC4 now bends back into the screen - So in actual fact its not a real 3D gun but all else is relatively good. Dont expect full deep 3D vision but more of a 3D feel which is far better than standard 2D.  For those who are real keen on getting a game working well in 3D try doing a web search for Helix mod 3d. Helix releases some fabulous fixes for 3D games. FC4 is a very immersive game with main quests, side quests, spontaneous quests and ability/skill development all the way. It is a thoroughly enjoyable game as is the rest of the franchise so get out there and get yourself some Kyrat fulfilment. My rating? 9 out of 10 rubber chickens!  Ratcat.;6801;Well I have been playing First person shooters in 3D for years (over 10)  and submitting 3D reviews to IMDB for years as well.

1586;Perhaps you are thinking that i just suck at gaming and maybe i do, but the fact is that i downloaded a trainer to cheat/complete this game (so i didnt kill myself or smash my monitor out of frustration) and the game is STILL tedious and difficult.  I give this game a 7 for great story, characters, graphics, environment but VERY tedious and difficult gameplay.;Dying Light had the chance to not merely be a great Zombie game but to be a GREAT GAME,  but unfortunately some of the games mechanics and controls make it tedious and outright difficult to the point of pulling you right out of the game and questioning, Arent i supposed to be having fun and not shutting down my PC mid-game out of shear rage?    The graphics, environment, and character design are absolutely jaw-dropping - I never realized i had a scare of heights until i played this game - the wind, the character using his arms to balance himself, the sound of objects dropping down below - whew, i had severe vertigo.  The various missions and voice-actors are also very impressive (and what reminds me a lot of the Metro 2033 series).  The deep intergration of parkour means that you can not get ANYWHERE without jumping, climbing, and falling your way there - this can be fun...sometimes, but to integrate it as the main form of player transportation throughout the game is gimmicky and tiresome.  Also, it is simply unrealistic that the MAJORITY of citizens (zombie and normal) would be parkour experts.    The constant need to repair and place weapons because they wear out, also makes the game very tedious...i understand that this would happen with SOME weapons, but not metal bats and crowbars, cmon!! Furthermore, the controls for various skills that one aquires throughout the game by earning points completing missions are so complex and similar to eachother, that i often end up performing the wrong skill, sometimes even literally throwing away one of my best weapons at an enemiy (after which it cannot be retrieved).    The enemies were really awesome and well-designed, though i wish there had been a little bit more variety with enemy types (although there was a lot of varieties WITHIN each enemy type - which is awesome).  Finally, although the various side-missions are intricate and intersting - the overarching main story of the game is rather lackluster.    (p.s. i didnt check my spelling because im used to spellcheck already incorporated into a websites text fields - HINT HINT igdb);3042;My name is Jon-Laurence and upon recently purchasing and putting about 20 hours into this game, I must say that Dying Light is the greatest zombie game I have ever played.  However, that is not to say that it is a great game, although it could have been.  It should be noted that this is my second attempt at playing this game, simply because the first time i tried playing it i ended up uninstalling it due to its difficulty and steep learning curve.;lackluster main story, steep learning curve, complex controls, tedious game mechanics, many aspects of the game simply are not fun - they just evoke anger and frustration.;6;side-missions, characters, graphics, environment, enemy design.;Visually wonderful but mechanically tedious;4285;34630
1587;All in all I give this game, though obviously biased, a 9/10 and recommend it to any hardcore RPG fan.;Ill keep this short: Good isometric graphics with a rather unique design style (portraits, environments, etc.), really wonderful music, nice turn based combat system that actually doesnt get boring. Apart from that I really liked the fact that there were whole missions that could have been resolved without wasting a single bullet, the whole role-playing thing comes in play here. I liked the thing that the game wasnt that linear, and just like the previous series of the title but more so actually in this game past actions do influence future outcomes.  The story and the whole game atmosphere was also very good, revealing itself as the game progressed. The China thing really strikes as an unique environment, differentiating itself from the previous two Shadowrun Retruns games. The characters were really original and non boring, might be a personal opinion, but you get attached to them the same way you would in games such as Planescape: Torment or NWN2: Mask of the Betrayer, two other games that excelled at this, in my opinion. There are of course bad stuff: occasional bugs, where a character would appear in the matrix twice, or a quest might sometimes get bugged, though without breaking it, at least on my patched version, Ive read stuff about missions being bugged from time to time but I never experience it. Comparing it to its predecessor Dragonfall, the game was surprisingly easy, and I was expecting a much much more hard fight for the end game. NPC dialogues also seemed a little pushed, I mean really, those people like to talk and talk and it sometimes annoying, it was better done I think in previous titles. Apart from that there were stuff that felt quite unfinished, but dont really know if they are like that or just a flaw in design that would hint this way.;11772;Ive played a lot of RPGs, all manner of them I think from hack and slash Diablo series to Baldurs Gate, Star Wars: KOTOR, Mass Effect, Might and Magic, etc.  All games I have mentioned have the trait of being top of the line while being somewhat fundamentally different then the others. The whole Shadowrun Returns series has attached itself to this list, in my opinion.;small bugs / flaws, some (few) things feel unfinished, game surprisingly easy on hard difficulty, dialogues sometimes annoying.;6;Great ups for music, storyline, characters and combat;Best RPG Ive played this year.;813;37943

Those girls really need a guy to guide them and protect them from other guys that want to fuck them. I promise that it wont backfire you at all.;Made by random people from totally different countries, time zones and continents  based of an original idea posted in 4chan  and not only free to play, but with any option to donate any money to them if you want, someone can only expect the worse: To find a crappy game, random sex scenes and situations and/or dialogue that if you laugh at them you could get a free spot to hell.  However, Katawa Shoujo isnt anything like that. THANK-FUCKING-FULLY.  This game is not perfect. However, considering that is free and amateur, makes this top-notch. With beautiful scenearios, many, varied and detailed CGs and a really small but excellent soundtrack, Katawa Shoujo is a work that the people in 4leaf studios put many hours of work. And it shows.  The art and the story is really great, however, you will need to read a lot and take this game very seriously. Something hard to do, giving its premise and the amounts of text it has, compared with the little choices you can get, especially in certain routes (it could be worse though, there are visual novels with way more text), maybe. But it pays, so no worries. I would extend more, but I dont want to overhype you or spoil you. So download it, run the game, and let the music of the main title play for a while. It is really good for atmosphere.;9648;You want to read A LOT? You want to enter in the world of visual novels but didnt know how? Look no more!

1601;Como o jogo é cativante e envolvente! Lembro de ficar o feriadão de Pascoa todo jogando. Não zerei o jogo, mas as 126h jogadas foram mais que suficientes para me apaixonar por este jogo fantástico. Pra quem zerar(pretendo), rezerar(opção do jogo) e ainda sentir saudade, tem outros jogos da franquia e até uma série de animês. A nota do jogo como diria o pessoal do 99vidas.com.br, 99vidas honestas!;Tudo começa com você numa limousine com um cara esquisito e uma mulher. Ele começa a falar algo que você não entende direito, mas tu saca que ele é seu Morpheu e você é o Neo. Aí você acorda no trem, indo pra uma cidade do interior, pra morar com seu tio viúvo e sua priminha. Cidade nova, casa nova, escola nova. E tv nova ligando a meia-noite sozinha! Na tv passa imagens chuviscadas de uma pessoa e você se sente puxado pela tv. No dia seguinte tá todo mundo falando do Canal da Meia-noite, que só aparece em dias com neblina e que, ao que parece, mostra pessoas que estavam desaparecidas. Investigando sobre, você acaba, entre uma ida e outra DENTRO DA TV, montando seu grupo de exploradores que viram investigadores quando um desaparecido é encontrado morto. Desde início você constrói Elos Sociais com cada personagem que habilita um bônus em cada aspecto da sua personalidade, que aparecem na forma de Personas(materializações das várias faces da sua personalidade). A sensação que os Elos Sociais te dão é de interação total com todos ao redor da sua personagem(que como todo jrpg leva seu nome, a não ser que você seja um cara zoeiro). Há também os atributos que são acrescidos com algo que você faça, como um Elo Social desenvolvido, um livro lido, um trabalho de meio expediente ou respondendo uma pergunta da professora. Há várias missões paralelas que você pega com npcs aleatórios. Nem os inconvenientes encontros aleatórios(como dizemos em rpg), que me fizeram desistir de Final Fantasy e Pokemon, são brilhantemente apresentados(como monstros rastejantes ou flutuantes descoloridos) de forma que você pode vê-los, evitá-los e até surpreendê-los, ganhando vantagem no combate por turno. O lance de catalogar cada persona é muito prático pra fazer fusões de personas superpoderosas futuras. Que serão muito úteis mais adiante.;9600;Persona chegou até meu conhecimento quando comprei uma revista Playstation, na vã esperança de atualizar os jogadores do meu PES.

Honestamente(na verdade desonestamente), consegui a ISO do jogo num site e fiz meu DVD. Não me julguem, tinha um PS2 desbloqueado em 2009 e meu país taxa video game como jogo de azar.

1602;Overall Akibas Trip was fun. I really enjoyed it. Its not as weird as some might think.;This game was great. The story was very interactive. the things your make your character say really do matter for the end of the game. It also flowed very well and made sense. You were not just ripping the clothes off of enemies for nothing. They are weak to sunlight and they explode when they have to much contact with the sun.  Also the combat system was simple enough to learn. Do combos and cluster attacks. How they set up the upgrade feature was nice. It was very simple. If I can figure it out, anybody can. You can upgrade hats, shirts, pants, and weapons. And the weapons to choose from all do different moves.  Sound and graphics were good, Nothing to complain about.;7268;I know this game has a bit of a reputation. But it really isnt that bad. It is really fun.

1603;Overall I love this game. I really think if made today it would be incredible.;This game was really fun. Open world stunt racing combat. You can race. Its Hot Wheels. Of course you can race. The races were all drag races. So no laps at all. Then stunt driving was a neat feature too. You can go off of crazy jumps and do tricks to rack up points to fill your turbo meter to use in the race to go faster. The combat was great. Running around the giving map and collecting the weapons to use on the other cars. Really powerful weapons. There was a little adventure mode. When you finish levels you unlock new cars and other joy ride levels. The joy ride levels are the open world levels were you can collect ten red gears to get a new car or find the hidden key to get a new car. You can also try the challenge mode. Some of the challenges are super difficult. Couldnt beat them as a kid and I still cant beat them.  The music was good. Very Hot Wheel like. The graphics were not perfect. But good enough to were I cant complain. And all the selection of cars you can unlock was great. A real variety. Classic Hot Wheel cars, trucks, and a bus.;2653;This game was fantastic for its time. I really wish a modern Hot Wheels game similar to it would exist.;;21;-cars -gameplay -music;Hot Wheels;169;596
1605;;- WARNING: I explain in detail about a certain characteristic of the story that is pretty famous already. Its not tecnically a spoiler, but you can foreshadow easily what will happen if you read this. Read at your own risk!  The Walking Dead is a point and click adventure where you have to solve puzzles and make decisions, that Telltale claims that will affect future events of the story.  And as a story (the main point of this game), the narrative is excellent. The characters feel real. They have some out-of-character moments, but youll feel pitty of the good guys and want to kill the assholes as soon as the option pops out. It is really long, as well. For this kind of games, that is (arround 10 hours beating the main story). The situations that will present in front of you are the point-and-click type. Click things, observe stuff, pick objects, use it to solve things. You know, since the rest of the crowd you hang with apparently are cluless. But its not that bad. Thats classic point-and-click stuff afterall. Good references.  This game has all the ingredients to be a masterpiece. Well, it cant be in other way: we are talking about an indie that came out the same year as Journey and still got many attention. I would give it a 10/10. 25/3 for the ending.  But it isnt. And you know why?  This game LIES. Its the biggest liar I saw in a while. More than AAAs. More than [insert not-trusty person here that you dont like]. And I cant pass that.  I can pass that this game has a little of game and more than interactive movie. I can pass that they used a franchise about shooting zombies and there isnt any zombie shooting. In fact, I appreciate that.   But I cant pass a game that tells me all your decisions will affect the story and does EVERYTHING IT CAN to ignore your decisions. No matter how decesive a decision looks: by the next episode (or sooner), youll see that had no relevance to the plot. And if it did, it will be nullfilled very soon. And this dulls the game. It dulls the game, because the story youll read is basically the same no matter what you do. They dull the characters the game puts so much effort to build up, because they will do certain scripted things, no matter if you befriended them or treat them horrible. Sometimes they will act different... but thats because this decision is not crucial to advance the plot. To advance it to the ending the creators had in mind. A good one, but the only one.  Thats why I had to quit it so much points. Its not that the story or the ending is bad. They are good. But they didnt let me decide if I liked more the other options. Despite they told me I would. Too much wasted potential to deserve the perfect score.;1871;;;45;;ITS A TRAP!;4650;39414
1607;Conclusion: Laras new Journey is definitely a step in the right direction forward from its predecessor. I wouldnt describe it as broken but more flawed. All in all everything works. The characters are real, the story has big enough curveballs and twists to drive the narrative, the game is wealthy in its own history, and the gameplay is deep. Its just not good enough to play through twice. If I honestly had to give the game one complaint is that it wasnt difficult. I beat the game on Survivor mode, its hardest difficulty, and still finished it in about 9/10 hours with an almost 80% completion. The last fight was a little cliched and anti-climactic, but the very last cinematic made up for it. The game didnt end on a cliffhanger, but there will definitely be another one. Personally, Im skeptical to where the narrative is headed, but Im just thinking worst case scenario. As long as the next Tomb Raider holds to this formula, and keeps its mature and adult themes, I will definitely be a modern fan of Lara Croft.;EyeCandy: The visuals of this newest Tomb Raider are great. The environment and texture artists really outdid themselves in this installment driving home an authentic feel of wherever the journey takes you. A lot of time, detail, and professionalism went into the world of Laras adventure and it shows. I myself have never been to Russian prisons, mass grave sites and torture chambers, or Byzantine tombs,  but if I ever do end up in one of those bizarre places I would imagine it would look exactly like this game. Even the areas that werent completely void of life were warm and rich with creatures and fauna. It doesnt matter where you traverse in this universe, whether it be crawling through glaciers, sidling on cliffs in a cave, or solving ancient puzzles in hidden tombs. This world is real.  SoundDesign: I was pleasantly pleased at the audio engineering and even a little surprised. The sounds are Hi-Fi, custom and believable, and the ambiance is incredible and really elevates you to the games peak by its excellent job of immersion. The soundtrack holds originality and has a few memorable tracks youll be hoping to hear every now again. To me it wasnt a boring blend of instruments and themes already explored and are found in standard AAA video games and movies. The actors performances are all incredible and I even got attached to a man that was never revealed in the game. I caught myself searching for a non existent characters diary entries, essentially, for the simple fact that it was very progressive, and the voice actor was an incredible narrator. Which leads me into the games dialogue. While it doesnt sit near the writing of The Witcher, every character has their own tone, emotions, and every interaction is unique. If the devs can hear me, keep at this level right here. You have it right.  Gameplay: Rise of the Tomb Raider takes on its new traditional formula of gameplay and added a hell of a lot to it. The game kept its fire camps to upgrade your weapons, spend skill points, and fast travel to other unlocked base camps in the game while Lara chats up little summaries and thoughts of recent events. While I upgraded and added more skills to her repertoire I couldnt help but notice a couple things. Some of the skills are recycled from the first one (makes sense) and some skills are completely useless. Some skills do stack on top of others and add to the base skill which is nice, but there wasnt much improved or added in this department. Just an observation. Over in the weapons section is also the same from the previous title. Theres the bow, the pickaxe, and your selection of different variants of a pistol, rifle, and shotgun giving Lara an arsenal of up to four weapons in total giving her an advantage in any situation and the developers being able to adhere to any play style. For example, if like me, youre the type for a heavy offense, I would recommend the Compound Bow, Automatic Shotgun, Heavy Pistol, and the SMG. Youll already have one type of each at your disposal, but its up to you to explore and find all the pieces you can to build said special weapons. But then this game goes deeper with its crafting system. For each weapon, theres alternate ammo types. The arrows can be armed with a grenade, lit on fire, or sabotaged with a poison (which is my personal favorite) or maybe you want some dragonfire rounds for your shotgun? The option is there. But to get these ammo types you must loot and scrounge to find the basic items: cloth, wood, metal nuts and springs, animal pelts, and so on. This is either a highlight or the nadir of the craft system because it can get overwhelming. Your weapons and gadgets can have attachments, your skills can have skills, its honestly a little bit of a spider webs mess. Everything seems intertwined, and for the first time in a very long time, I actually didnt disable the pop-up tutorials just because this game is jam packed with all sorts of little features that arent utilized the entire game. Not a real problem though unlike the games controls and direction. Lara was definitely a tad clunky in certain spots. All game, she is constantly leaping platforms like Nathan Drake, climbing cliffs and mountain sides like one of Desmonds ancestors, and killing and shooting like a madman. Woman, sorry. The environment climbing will send you plummeting into pits of doom because of wrongly registered input controls and the combat mechanics are very dry heavily relying on shallow gunplay. The reason why both of those are problems are because it leads to unnecessary checkpoint reloading, which isnt gamebreaking because Crystal Dynamics are very forgiving with their checkpoints. No, really, the game autosaves every couple minutes and I never once dreaded reloading a checkpoint in fear of having to start over from who knows where so that almost makes up for it. But the gun combat, while slightly non-redundant, slightly doesnt make sense. Example, your given the choice to upgrade any weapon of your choosing by utilizing the crafting system I briefly described earlier, and while its very possible to upgrade a weapons damage, rate of fire, and reload speed, an option is also a guns recoil stability. Not accuracy, recoil stability. That means no matter how many junk parts you throw into your jerry-rigged AK47, or how true your aim is in a firefight, the weapon will never shoot where it is aimed. I wouldve lost count if I tried to keep track of how many heads I missed just because the bullet would travel outside of the on-screen reticle. Those two aspects of the game were the most frustrating in my experience. Lara, seemingly intentional, jumping to her death, and a useless gun attribute. Cant hit a single enemy at point blank because of the bullet spread, but at least the gun wont travel upwards.;7323;Rise of the Tomb Raider stars the infamous Lara Croft in her second prequel game while shes still growing up, essentially. You take to the lands of Syria and Siberia uncovering your fathers secrets and furthering his research in search of an object called the Divine Source. The story is well driven, paced very well, and was never really dull at one moment. Most characters are very interesting and have a lot of depth to them save probably one out of the eight main characters that the game revolves around. Along in the game are collectibles of tape recordings, lost documents, scrolls, etc, that are read aloud by a multitude of voices in the game. Upon discovery of all the hidden goodies it fills in the backstory and this presents the game and characters history very well. Sadly though, the story doesnt leave an everlasting effect. It almost has that X factor, its right there, but theres no motivation to experience the story more than once.;Doesnt leave an everlasting impression No incentive for 100% completion Unnecessary mechanics Easy;49;Driven and exciting story Voice actors Visuals;Rise of the Tomb Raider Written Review;1370;40479

1609;In conclusion, this is an experience where I dont want to play again because I wont be able to experience the same feelings as I did the first time through. When you finish Hearts of Stone it will be like finishing a really good TV show. You dont want it to end and its bittersweet. When it did end, I only felt one immediate emotion. Satisfaction. CD has A LOT to live up to if they want to top this one. With all that being said, I can not wait for Blood and Wine.;The main storyline is 10-12 hours depending on your play style not including new side quests. Theres new armor, weapons, an introduction to a whole new mechanic called Runes, a whole new culture and populous, and most importantly, more Gwent. More is to be said about the new addition, but thats the gist of it. Its still the same game but is an expansion overall, only helping and adding to the vanilla experience.  It starts wherever you personally last left off. Once you start the quest though it throws you right into the mix of things and not even 20 minutes in youre already meeting new characters, fighting difficult monsters, and crawling through sewers. But that momentum comes to a full stop because the first boss is insanely difficult. Like, Im talking Demon Souls difficult. First off, The Witcher in general isnt a fast paced game. So you cant hack and slash your way through like you would Dragon Age. Granted I was playing on the highest difficulty, but when I finally beat the Toad Prince I wasnt satisfied, nor did I get a sense of achievement and accomplishment. It was more like, Fucking FINALLY!. I even went on the internet because I completely thought I was doing something wrong. Come to find out, I wasnt, the boss is just hard as fuck. Then if that fight wasnt enough, CDPR throws you right into another one but this time the odds are stacked against your favor and this fight is almost as difficult as the first one. Thankfully, this guy is a little weaker. Its the surrounding elements that make it difficult.  But thats the only complaint. The crazy difficulty spike. I will say its almost a perfect intro into what youre about to embark upon. The game revolves mainly around three characters. Geralt the neutral protagonist, Olgierd von Everec the bandit captain, and the Merchant of Mirrors. Without revealing too much, Geralt is tasked with keeping three promises and to stick to his word, Geralt must put himself through the strangest trials hes ever gone through.  Hearts of Stone will take you on a rollercoaster ride. Emotionally, gameplay wise, mentally, it hits you where you feel it most. From being in a circus, to attending a wedding and partaking in all of the party favors. From participating in an auction, to planning a heist Grand Theft Auto style (yes, and you get to personally choose who to recruit) and then entering in a lifeless void of a world simply created by someones painting.  And no matter how peculiar or out-of-this-world the Witcher gets, it feels so natural because the writing brings it all together perfectly. Hearts of Stone will constantly conflict you and your motives constantly keeping you guessing and speculating the motives of each character. Every line of dialogue is still as precise and specific as ever in delivering the perfect string of words or phrases to perfectly convey the heavy emotion that this game plays at you. It is not for the faint of heart.  But the expansion isnt all somber. Old flames (if youve read the books) return and this new love interest actually ended up being my favorite. Triss still wins all, but this new woman was definitely a close runner-up. Shes like the light in a darkened world. And fret not, The DLC is still as mature and adult as ever still bringing to you the 18+ themes that arent meant for children. So, yes, sex and titties.  For (at this time) 20 US Dollars, Hearts of Stone is easily obtainable. I forgot to mention that the DLC is only half that though. I bought the full edition that came with two complete and perfectly detailed physical Gwent decks. So really, this can be picked up for ten bucks. Some people spend 60 bucks for an incomplete game, a day one patch, and microtransactions. But thats none of my business.;12503;Im not gonna lie, I get a little excited whenever Projekt Red puts anything out.

1611;;One of the greatest racers of all time, I loved this game and played it for hours on end. Only ever completing about 50% of it. The control system is awesome and really feels natural to drive and handbreak turn around the roads. The city is massive and really becomes well known quickly. The challenges are tough throughout the game and provide a lot of variety to keep you interested.

1612;Overall I would say that the game is really captivating. In the beginning you feel like a fish out of water, but as soon as you get the hang of the different puzzles and styles you can easily find yourself playing for hours.  I didnt 100% the game, but I did finish the story element and that alone took me about 18 hours.;I didnt really know what to expect from the game when I first booted it up. I have always loved games like Myst, Syberia and Riven and at first I thought The Witness would be something similar. While Myst is more of a clue solving game The Witness is straight up a puzzle game. At first that really put me off. I was really looking forward to explore this beautiful island, find clues and solve them da Vinci Style, but the game soon had me hooked and I was solving puzzles left and right.  The Witness is is really a beautiful game, the scenery changes throughout the island and so does the puzzles. Some of the puzzles are really easy and some of them makes you pull your hair in agony. Theres also a story element to the game, and as you go along you will find yourself closer to an understanding as you gather bits and pieces of it.;5601;Just finished playing The Witness and oh boy am I glad Im done. What felt like 200 hours and like a bad crack addiction is finally over. The game is set on a beautiful island and bear some similarities with the Myst series.

1613;I really recommend that you try this game. Every now and again I encounter a game that I want to spread around and try to get as many people as possible to play to share my wonderful experience-this is definitely one of those. Dont miss it!;I absolutely loved this game. The artwork is creative and immersive, and allows you to sink right into the story despite the lack of realism. The story is intimate, and brutally honest in terms of the violence and tragedy of World War I, and although I disagree with a few of the historical theories presented-the facts are entirely accurate. The controls are very tight, and I did not find many bugs at all while playing the game. The puzzles are clever, but certainly not particularly complicated. This I personally like, as it means the story continues fluidly without any awkward interruptions. I openly admit that I cried at the end of this game. Absolutely fabulous.;7327;As a long-time gamer and lover of both indie platformers and history-this game is a great fit for me.

1614;I totally recommend that game to almost any kind of gamer. Puzzle-lovers, arcade-kind, artsy-junkies, indie-lovers, a little bit of action-like maybe, and anyone who loves a good genre-free game.;Reviewing  this game is a bit tricky biz. Because it is more of a piece of interactive art, than a game. And every spoiled bit of info ruins a byte of experience. So i regret watching the trailer. But on the other hand - its a real pain in the ears to make someone not so open-minded to play a game called The Pony Island. I still cant persuade the tow of my video-game-junkie friends to try ti (Ive told them not to watch the trailer).     The game starts like a trivial puzzle joke-like game with simple lo-fi graphics. But it ... like evolves. So give it a time. It has awesome motivating soundtrack. More of that - it has weirdly astonishing SFX. You will get it, when It talks to you. Thought its graphic is very simple and schematic it manages to have style. Some special effects just make my eyes melt with joy. The game-play and controls are so simple and responsive, that you get used to it in no time. Play-time is rather short, though (around 1.5-2 hours). Is it a pro or con - decide yourself. As for the story - it gave me creeps all the time, thought it is not scary at all. The game does not try to scare you. It more like makes you afraid of yourself of some kind, but you just cant stop.;15734;Do you like ponies? Do you like ponies, like I do? No one cares.

1616;Shrek 2 was the victim of a weak advertisement campaign, and if you are willing to look for a copy, what you will find is the progenitor for some of the greatest games of the past decade.;The world that was constructed for the video game adaptation of Shrek 2 was incredible. Hundreds of fairy tales from centuries of European storytelling were brought in to create a vast, open-world to explore, rivaling Bethesdas Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises, which had not yet come to fruition at the time. This was a unique endeavor, as video games rarely borrow from real-world storytelling, instead opting to use original characters and settings. Each character arc, however short, manages to have huge emotional pull thanks to the return of the voice cast of the movie, and a soundtrack consisting of the full works of Smash Mouth. Throughout exploration, the game employs an intricate, timing-based swordplay system which has you fighting one-on-one against a cast of well-known fantasy creatures, each one forcing you to develop a unique strategy. Sometimes, your shield will save you, and in others, it will be tossed aside by an enemy too powerful. Sometimes, a blind enemy is best fought using the masterful stealth system, developed during consultation with Hideo Kojima. The complexity of the combat in Shrek 2 is almost indescribable, and I think it would be best for everyone to experience it themselves.;3668;The teams at Activision had done it again. Amidst the releases of the first Call of Duty and Guitar Hero games, Shrek 2 was quickly brushed aside by most gamers.

1617;Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is a very fun, addictive, and beautiful game that has much to offer the player if they are willing to endure a few moments of frustration as you work through its many puzzles.;Klonoa: Empire of Dreams on Gameboy Advance is a spectacle of game design. It has fluid controls, a colorful and clean art style, and it is fantastically paced. Most levels require a linear solution, but there are many opportunities to tweak the solution, allowing the player to test their dexterity and strategy while solving puzzles. The game provides plenty of precise visual feedback as the player experiments, but the games graphics occasionally grow boring due to the lack of unique details in the levels. The games story is told through picture book-style cut scenes, and scarce story development is experienced through player interaction. The story shares themes and tone with the Playstation title, Klonoa: Door to Phantomile. The music serves to offer a distinct mood to the gameplay and the sound design is clear and expressive, but the audio presentation is bland and lacks any notable features.  The games greatest strength is the level design. It is cleverly designed to push the players understanding of the games basic mechanic of grabbing objects and jumping off those objects to attain greater height. This simple mechanic is used in a wide variety of settings, where sharp timing and a well-thought strategy will always lead the player to success. The game can feel very difficult at times, as the layout of the level is limited to the Gameboy Advances resolution, forcing the player to mentally visualize various switches and enemy patterns before jumping into action. This can make some levels feel harder than they would be if the player was able to see a larger field of view.;6492;I enjoy puzzles, beauty, and fun design in games.;Lack of Detail in Environments Small Field of View;24;Charming Art Style Great Pacing Clever Level Design;A Handheld Dream;5093;46712
1618;;American Truck Simulator is fun, to an extent. The world we were given at release for free contained two states, California and Nevada. The rest of the states from what we were told will be purchasable DLC and nobody knows for sure how many more states they will throw in. Of course, anyone who enjoys the game for more than a couple hours wishes they could commit themselves to a cross country delivery and just a leisurely drive across the US of A but unfortunately it just doesnt look like that will happen. The game will probably get better over time but in its current state as I am writing this review I give it a 7/10.  The graphics are fun and not too exciting (you arent staring at Fallout 4 while driving)  The game mechanics are alright but no visible destruction to the trucks takes the fun away from the simple minded.

1619;;As other reviewers have previously mentioned if you have an AMD based rig avoid this game entirely. It is completely unplayable, and I am not exaggerating in the least when I say this.

With this in mind you would think based on the minimum system requirements set by SQUADs developers Id at least be able to play the game on its lowest possible graphics settings. Guess again, this game with graphics settings all turned on low and all optimization advice followed from SQUADs sub-reddit, doesnt even run above 25-FPS ever!   And if it does it stutters like crazy. I also know it has nothing to do with latency because all servers I played on had less than 60 ping. To be honest I have no clue how this game is available for purchase on Steam as its essentially a crime considering the price.   I am not new to playing pre-alphas or alphas and I am not a new PC gamer. This is the only game I have ever requested a refund for and I have purchased hundreds of games from Steam.

1627;There are probably solutions to these issues but ultimately the complexity of the game is both its best and its worst feature. The interface is extremely minimal and non-descript, I spent more time on google than playing the game which is not really what I signed up for. There was always some pedantic reason why my expectations were not being met by the gnomes, some build list out of order or skill not assigned. Those things should really be displayed in such a way that I can more easily problem solve my errors instead of allowing gnomes to be idle when there is work to be done.;Fun music, graphics and story concepts make this really attractive to me. The pixel art is gold and the level of complexity in the engine is impressive. I had a lot of fun observing how the gnomes behave when I altered the map or laid out instructions, that alone can happily soak up a few hours. Each time you play youll learn new things that perhaps you wish you knew earlier, unfortunately it may be too late for several of your gnomes, like me, youll probably start over a couple of times with your new knowledge. The surprise events and map generation keeps the experience fresh every time and thats always a welcome addition. However, I find I can only get 2 or 3 hours out of each game before things start behaving strangely and I am tempted to start over. Here are a few things that prompted me to start over and eventually quit the game forever...  It took too long for me to figure out how to find stone, so my gnomes died of thirst as there was no well. My best miner gnome marooned himself on a floating platform and died of thirst, there was nothing I could do. My gnomes refused to build a well for so long that they died of thirst. Finally, my gnomes were attacked by goblins who wiped half of them out, there was not enough good gnome skills left and I couldnt be patient enough to wait for things to be done (if the gnomes would listen to my orders at all). Finally, the game disappeared with the not responding message and I lost my progress.;9627;Gnomoria is paving the way forward as many other dwarf fortress clones try to become more and more attractive to mainstream gamers.

1629;;The combination of gamer nostalgia, tight gameplay, and hardcore challenge got great reviews and sales on the downloadable console game market. But now the last of those elements, the challenging gameplay, can be adjusted in Capcoms second bite at the apple, Mega Man 10. This game introduces Easy Mode, a typical choice in most video games, but one that the long-running Mega Man series has actually never seen before. With most other features remaining very similar to 9, the most important consideration here is whether you think Easy Mode adds to the game, or perhaps hinders it.  Easy Mode makes hits to your character less damaging, hits to enemies more damaging, takes out some enemies here and there, and, perhaps most helpfully, puts new platforms down to prevent most falling deaths. These changes make a giant difference, and at least guarantee that youll live to see the end of the game this time with only a little work. It certainly expands the audience for the game, as surely many confronted Mega Man 9 two years ago only to die at the ends of Jewel Man one too many times and quit. Those same gamers can have an experience more on level with the difficulties of most games today, and breeze through the title.  Technically, the addition of an Easy Mode cant hinder the experience, because the gamer can simply choose to play on the normal difficulty if they wish. However, the fact remains that some players will cruise through the Easy Mode in a little over an hour, and fail to see whats so special about the Mega Man series. The fun comes in conquering the really tough challenges, in mastering each level layout one by one. When youre not simply compelled to overcome these hard circumstances to see the rest of the game, players become less likely to willingly go through it. More players can beat the game, but its possible that less will actually be having fun.  Mega Man 10 also adds in a challenge mode with dozens of shorter challenges for the player to complete. Some are simply boss fights from the main game, but most are like very short levels that focus on one specific skill, like perfect jumping, or destroying a specific type of enemy. This feature would be perfect, if it werent so tedious to retry a challenge. After you fail, the game spits you back out to the challenge menu, rather than simply including a retry button, which wastes a frustrating amount of time in-between each session.  Proto Man, before a paid DLC component, is included in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_10>Mega Man 10</a> from the get-go, giving a slightly different experience one can try. He is hurt more by each enemy blast, but he has a shield that protects him from many hits to compensate. That small difference, along with a sliding ability and the appearance change, are all the variety you get, but its still certainly a welcome addition.  Mega Man 10 doesnt try to add too much to what made its predecessor successful, which is just fine. The gameplay is still pitch-perfect, and the additions all add up to make it a more solid product for a wider range of gamers.;1718;When Capcom released Mega Man 9 in 2008, it immediately became clear that there was a real market in making games like its 1989.;;6;;PS3 Game Review - Mega Man;5431;51089

1632;;Okay, enough with the odd call backs.  Heres the deal. You probably  saw those kind of reviews tons of times, so Ill make it straight:  You want to play the most interesting indie in the recent years? See for yourself why the VGAs adwards make no sense? Perhaps you are kind of tired of JRPGs and you want to see something... different? Or maybe play something with a very good OST? Then congratulations, I think you are in the right place. Lets see if the Undertale story fits you, though...  Are linear, but well-explained stories for you? Do you like the flavour of a classic story? (You know, you end up in a random place: get out. Videogame-y enough for me). Do you like stories with a lot of humor? Do you like stories with a lot of drama?  Or, perhaps, you would like a story with some shades of horror?  If any of the answers is yes, then you should definetly check Undertale.;12517;You stare at the bottom of your screen. The twilight filters though your window.

1637;It certainly deserves to be played by every video game fan.;The minute you start the game you are sucked into a wonderful adventure. You get to explore a huge (for its time) land of Hyrule, you get to fight with some very creative bosses, you get to meet some fun characters. It just feels like a real adventure. Solving a dungeon, especially the last ones, feels satisfying. My favorite part of Zelda games is looking for heart container pieces. Finding them feels very satisfying too. I unfortunately havent beaten this game because right before the last dungeon I stopped playing for a couple of weeks. When I came back to the game I couldnt remember how to get to the dungeon. Its a very confusing road that leads you there. I was too lazy to look up the solution online so I just abandoned the game. And being confusing is my biggest negative point for this game. I bet that many people who read this review grew up with this game and know every nook and cranny of the map, but I find it too complicated. Especially the mountains, where you have to go into the dark world and back many times to explore everything. The story of the game is thin, but it doesnt matter. You just go from one dungeon to the next, who cares about the exposition the fairies share with you? What matters is how fun playing the game is.;1026;I really like this game, but I cant say anything about it that hasnt been said a million times already. Everyone knows this game, everyone loves it. And it deserves it.;Later dungeons get very tricky and confusing Hyrule is a vast and confusing place to navigate, getting to later stages makes your brain hurt Story doesnt matter. It might as well not even have one;19;Clever puzzles Fun bosses It provides you with an adventurous feeling A great improvement over an already great original game;Adventure!!!;854;5610

1641;Fucking love this game, the best RPG I have played in years.;The story is just incredible. It feels like a true rpg where you decisions do matter. Being a dick the entire game will give you a different outcome from someone playing a saint.   Combat once you get use to it feel really tight. Your attacks have weight and the different build styles are feel unique enough that the game doesnt just become spam OP attack by the late game.   Keyboard and mouse controls are a little loose by default and need some time to get good enough to be effective.   The graphics did see a downgrade from the original demo marketing material and the final release but the game still looks amazing regardless.   The DLC feels like real content as well. Its no tacked on bits that feel cut away from the base game. They feel like individual fleshed out story arcs you and experience along side the main game OR start with a character prebuilt for the dlc itself which is an amazing touch.;1942;;Keyboard and Mouse Controls  Graphics downgrade is a shame;6;Story is amazing  Combat is perfect.;The best game from the last few years;5853;53718

1664;The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is one of the best RPG games and one of the best games recently hands down. It offers us a massive gaming experience with everything in it (no need for DLCs) to get the full experience. Basically un-put-downable.;First of all this game is visually astonishing. Not only it has great graphics but also the animation makes this game even more realistic. The writing is never lazy on this one. They made every detail worth. Every choice shows its importance to story and to us as a character that we develop throughout the game. The game starts quietly and a little bit lineer at first. Introducing the game to the newcomers of course. Again we continue our story by playing Geralt of Rivia which some of the fans would know him from previous installments. As the first mission develops we start opening to a world, than a bigger one, than a bigger one. This game is just so big in every aspect. Maps, dialogue, missions, side missions, contracts. BIG is just the best way to describe this game. Storyline is almost perfect. Wild Hunt is pretty intimadating and you understand whats the a big deal  about them. Boss battles are good though it could have been better after all it is The Witcher 3. Fighting is spot on. And as you discover new ways to defeat monsters it gets pretty easy for you even at a hard difficulty which I think is a good thing. And also scavenging is also very enjoyable as you search for a better armor, a better weapon, getting your reward in the end. Main Story took me about 50 hours to beat and making the game %100 takes about 200 hours of gameplay plus high replay value. Also I have to say music of this game is the definitive Witcher soundtrack, it is great.;1942;The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt pleases players by granting us an enormous amount of content. Its by far game of the year for me.;High System Requirements, Boss battles could have been better.;6;Story, Graphics, Content, pretty much everything...;One of the Greatest...;459;55685
1666;Its simple yet addicting gameplay makes the gamers stick to the game and for a while at that. This game wont die for a long time now it is very fun to play with friends or alone.;Counter Strike series were always loved by huge amount of gamers even though it offered a simple gameplay depending on the users skills for FPS. And CSGO is one of the most competitive games you will ever play that alone is enough to keep this game alive. Vast amount of players are addicted to this game including me and my friends, playing the game with some friends makes the game even more fun. Other than that it has normal FPS game modes such as Team Deathmatch, Gun Game etc.;1372;Counter Strike: Global Offensive AKA CSGO is the newest addition to the franchise by Valve and it manages to fulfill our expectations.;Some cheaters still exist, could have including more game modes or even a story mode.;6;Competitive matches, pure Counter Strike gameplay;Competitive FPS gaming experience at its finest...;459;56372
1667;All in all, a buggy game (can be forgiven) with a short and pointless campaign (can also be forgiven) with basically nothing going for it that every pre 2004 historical RTS hadnt already done. One redeeming fact is that the game is genuinely a refreshing little addictive muse that plays on my nostalgic strings and has good music.;The game has two modes, freeplay and story, like most historical RTS games. Naturally I choose story and am immediately immersed into a text based narration of the protagonists biography. The narration jumps between a real time conversation involving a scribe and some random chick at a bar, then to the book they/he is writing, then to the events unfolding and finally to the game itself. So its kind of an off putting narration-ception... can I say that?  The game starts easy and limits the buildings and stages you can take as a beginner, in what is to be a tutorial that makes up the entire campaign. The story promises all sorts of adventures, war, disease and the looming duty of royal city builder but after three or four maps of tutorial it finally gives up and decides the ultimate goal in the game is to build a bath house and roll credits. What a rip off! Yes there is 6 hours of promised story game play but literally all of it is spent in tutorial. The final building you are allowed to build is a bath and the moment you build it the kings buddy pops up and says the wars over, lets all go for a pint.  The game is also buggy. Very buggy. Aside from the aesthetic bugs like birds being permanently stuck in buildings and the narrator repeating himself. There is no end of map-reset bugs, like villagers not being able to reach their spots, traders blocking the harbor despite having left the map and  unable to place buildings anywhere for no reason. All of that might be forgiven had they not made it IMPOSSIBLE to manually close any window without opening the quest screen.;18623;So a few days ago IGDB made a give-away facebook comp of a couple copies of this little indie game that took my fancy. Naturally I lost the competition but decided to get a copy anyway on the account I am a fan of RTS and indie... also that I have the worlds worst laptop and this is the only game that wouldnt turn it into a smoldering pile of molten disappointment. My reception of this game could be very easily mean and jaded like I would give to a triple A, but I give BumbleBee-games a chance and try to BumbleBee positive.;Read above... oh wait, €20???

1668;;I really liked this game but Ive never finished it because after a while I found it difficult. But in my opinion this game should be tried because of the fantastic graphic, story and music even if the story is not clear at all in the game time.  The game mechanics are nice and this game is a nice pastime. During the game you will unlock really fun special skills that make the game funnier. I didnt like the interactions between the commands and the movements.;7344;;I didnt like the interactions between the commands and the movements.;6;Music, graphics, gameplay and story (the story is not entirely clear).;Well done game;6362;58430
1669;Jokes aside, it is a nice game with a strange vibe (probably because of the translation?) that has many sub-plots, which is also cool since it is really repeatable.  And jokes aside as well, the route of the little girl is surprisingly good, thank god.;- Summer camps in Russia, with actually GOOD WEATHER. They didnt were cheapstakes in that.  - Communist lolis with impossible hair, the ultimate combination of russian and japanese absurdity. - Strange fanserivce censored by Steam. - Excellent artwork, which it is made obviously by one author, and it doesnt change in any noticeable way of style, seriously. - Lolis with CCCP t-shirts. - Plot that screams 2 d33p 4 u the second you start playing. - Communist lolis and cute girls calling you comrade, if you are into that. - A free DLC! Take that EA. - Communist little girls AND a neko girl which is the secret character (spoiler?). Yes, those guys have all the fetishes covered. - A horror sub-story because reasons - Little girls who like marx intelectually. - An unwinnable card game (seriously, that shit makes absolutely no sense). - Oh wait, did I mention that there are COMMUNI... ah, I see, youre not into that (I was starting to get worried).

1670;All in all, I was slightly disappointed. I was hoping for an exciting story and lovable characters.  I guess that Im glad I played it, but I probably wont return to it anytime soon like I did with the other Telltale games.;Not only am I a huge fan of Telltale Games, Im also a huge fan of The Walking Dead and the character, Michonne. So to hear about this game being in development made me extremely excited. Sadly, that excitement was short-lived. The Walking Dead season 1 left me crying for hours, season 2 made me hope for a season 3, and this game, left me with a numb feeling, as if I just lost a few hours of valuable time. Its a very short game, making me go huh, its already over? after each episode. Not only that, but the story isnt very interesting. The only thing that really made me invested enough in this, was Michonnes past. The rest just felt like fillers. Telltale are so talented when it comes to writing stories and characters, but the people in this game felt bland and rushed. The choices didnt affect you emotionally, as you didnt know the characters well enough. In other words, it didnt matter if certain people lived or died, because you didnt feel attached enough. Also, some scenes were just stupid.  The graphics feel like a slight improvement, and I really like Michonnes design. The music and sounds are amazing, and I love the intro scene. Its so well down and visually appealing to the eye! Another great thing are the voice actors. We got some real talents here, and Samira Wiley was a great pick for Michonne.;11204;Michonne is the only one standing strong when everyone else falls apart.;Boring story Dull, unforgettable characters Every episode was really short;6;Michonne The intro  Music & Sounds;Perhaps a slight downfall for Telltale?;3859;53741
1672;Its a good JRPG but it needs to improve some details.;I like a lot Sword Art Online: Lost Song. Its better than Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment, the previously game, in a lot of thing: graphics, gameplay, fps, but the plot is childish and poor and the gameplay can be a bit repetitive. This game has in ALfheim Online and you can fly, its amazing!;11842;I love Sword Art Online series and this game is amazing!;The plot is very childish.;48;The combat system.;Amazing!;6622;60278
1674;RymdResa provides an amazing experience and is definitely worth your time if meandering through a vast cosmos is a thing that you crave.;RymdResa is a space odyssey, a journey through the vast cosmos undertaken by a lone astronaut who lost his home planet to an asteroid. Resources are scarce and a few coordinates is all that he has. His goal and therefore yours is to find a new place to call a home.  The game does not offer much vis à vis gameplay in fact there is no combat. Instead, the main focus is exploration. From the haunting fact that is the infinite universe in which you are thrown to the mechanics, exploration is incentivized. The cosmos of RymdResa is colorful and filled with interesting things to see. In addition to the main objectives that obviously differ from chapter to chapter which amount to a total of three you can investigate various sites ranging from planets to abandoned satellites, collect items which you can use to upgrade your ship and research new tech for the same purpose. Some interesting encounters with boss-like entities and peculiar sites are part of the package.  Rather than investing in depth, RymdResa embraces the poetic side of itself via a brilliant combination of quasi minimalist art, well written text and great music. Rather than being a game about combat in space and killing aliens, it is a mesmerizing meander through space. Serene and relaxing yet it manages to convey solitude, desperation and melancholy.;11735;Roguelike, RPG elements and a procedurally generated world. The aforementioned terms help but do not quite manage to classify RymdResa, a game that is an oddity amidst the vast and ever expanding ocean of games. An oddity that manages to convey certain emotions that very few other games managed to.;;6;;Serene and relaxing...Mostly.;6689;60714
1678;all in all good game!;Straight at the beginning after character customisation is complete where the choice of gender to different life backgrounds are possible, you Land on your feet Commanding  the  soon to be infamous spaceship the SSV Normandy, Which with a crew Among who other large role characters will reside, including many new allies that will fight right by your side. Together You will be tearing through a collection of Missions scattered around different worlds all over the Galaxy. I was happy with the Normandy serving as the primary mode of transportation as there is a lot of content Integrated within it and serves as a good home base. And would personally quite like one in real life. shame.   You reside in the year 2183. The task you have been given is to investigate a likely threat of an ancient alien race known as the reapers. Being apart of an alliance your duty Is to investigate any possible threats and therefore take action which is great as your abilities to free roam are fairly endless.  Interaction plays a big part in Mass Effect as the interaction menu is available with many characters which enable you to gather information needed To progress, as well as understanding different aspects of their Personal lives. this makes the game a lot more personal overall.   The ability to have two squad members of your selection by Your side results in being very productive throughout missions, as different characters have varied abilities. All these abilities are upgradeable with points within the game which you can assign to the characters individually.  This is a good move I thought as you can expand what abilities you find most useful/comfortable. For an example, classes like engineer providing technology needs like Shields and in sync with the use of biotic class that can issue powerful attacks on those hard to get enemies, is very rewarding.  Having two squadmates with varied abilities like this with you, can prove to be Very useful. I found that maybe a bigger selection of weapons on this game could have been better, as has only a  medium sized selection of handguns, shotguns and sniper rifles.  But the game does make up for it in the level design of bizarre different Worlds and the busy cities that are available for exploration. Exploration playing a massive part as many of the weapon upgrades and discoverable findings will be scattered across in mission pickups and planet findings, as well as interacting with the other characters in the game. This can get tedious at points as it is not uncommon to have to review past conversations, go from point to point in every section of planets for the satisfaction of 100% completion.;73;Mass Effect is a game title which will never be forgotten easily. Bioware Have not failed To develop a vast expanse of universe, characters and a plot which is More in depth and intense than most sci-fi games or films ever made in my opinion. Mass Effect was released on Xbox around November 2007 where Demiurge Studios then released it may 2008 for Windows. In which for many people it was a godsend as the PC was a better standard of gameplay.;could do with a better assortment of weapons;12;lots of good points but what mainly sticks out is in depth story and characters.;Mass Effect 1;4153;63424
1680;They really have done well living up to expectations of fans and critics and have definitely resolved many of the issues and problems brought to light From the first Mass Effect. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs even if sci-fi might not be of taste as before I was sceptical myself. Very glad I got involved with this game. cant think of many faults whatsoever.;Your fight continues against the destructive alien machine race called the reapers and now the threat of the insectoid Species called the collectors. Also a corporation called cerberus starts playing a big part. With an epic start in which Involves the Normandy, you get introduced to the head of cerberus the Illusive man. You now collaborate with cerberus and begin to investigate large number of abductions and disappearances of human colonies all over the Galaxy with the reapers being the Likely cause. Joined by some of the previous main characters and also a brand new selection who you will encounter throughout the game, ”the fight continues”.  You now have the option to import your character from the previous game and it is advised to complete the first Mass Effect to the best of your abilities as it will contribute to this game. Many of the choices You made in the first game will also affect the plot and gameplay in this sequel as well as the last instalment of this trilogy Mass Effect 3. It is hard to give examples of many of these without giving away the plot. and I hate spoilers!!! One of the best things so far in my eyes is the available choice of intimate relations with the characters in game depending on whether youre up for a bit of blue Asari tale or a steaming session with a kind of psychotic skinhead bird named Jack who could of Broke out of some rehab somewhere. The possibilities are endless!! At least if all else fails you can now show off your moves in the nightclub while also getting drunk at the bar, then come to a conclusion its just easier to watch a stripper of an alien race. Not far from reality sometimes eh??   This game is definitely credited for the outstanding performances by the voice actors who really brought this game to life. From great voice actor roles by Mark Meer/Jennifer hale who play shepard depending on the gender you pick, to Legends like D.C Douglas know by the  title “the voice-over Guy” who plays Legion. In collaboration with Jack Wall who again composed the music for this sequel while also aiming for a more in depth and darker sound to set the right atmosphere for the scene or scenario in the game.  There are many changes they have been made for Mass Effect 2 including limited ammunition with the more realistic action of having to reload clips in battle,  And also regenerable health, quite handy. There is roughly the same amount of weapons but there is the introduction of heavy weapons which can be picked up in various missions. A number of available DLCs are available which include different character outfits and included weapons within. Multiplayer action has now been brought to the table where the online players fight alongside each other against waves of cerberus or collectors. it is a fun mode of gameplay but I found it can be quite limited and irritating depending on the skill of the players you are with. They have stepped up gameplay in many ways including better visual graphics with a lot smoother frame rate which of course is expected of a sequel. They have done very well with this considering the engine is for 360 and PS3.  Theres a nice upgrade to the aiming system added points for headshots which all contribute in points for leveling up and increasing abilities of your selection as before. One of my favourite things and elements of the game, the ship the Normandy has now undergone drastic changes and advancements. This includes an new armory, the crew’s own quarters, your own quarters including space for collectible items which i found amusement in collecting, to also Tech Labs where ship and character upgrades are available. The ship is now managed by an AI under the name EDI which is a cool idea. They have changed the galaxy map menu as well as limiting fuel for the ship which has to be purchased or discovered  throughout the Galaxy. A probe system for discovering resources necessary for upgrades has been put in place which is different. Many good things have been adapted or enhanced to make it an overall jump up from its predecessor.;74;Being the second instalment of the trilogy designed for Xbox 360 Windows PC PlayStation 3, Mass Effect 2 had a lot to live up to Being a sequel of the first major hit Mass Effect. Bioware Definitely injected this sequel with new ideas and a better essence of gameplay while also  buffering out a lot of the things people complained about in the first game. Mass Effect 2 was released for Xbox 360 and PC on the 26th of January 2010 and then later released for PlayStation 3 a year later 28th of January 2011.;only one thing that stood out to me that i can remember is not being able to use an assault rifle unless your character is set to soldier. not huge but Im one for weapon choice;12;love the advancements  and changes they made.

1698;Obviously, since it is such a short game, I cant go into too much detail about the plot or even any events that occur in the story itself. All of it is there, waiting for you to discover it all yourself.  If you have a ps4, and its still June 2016 when you are reading this, then go and get it for free now. Otherwise invest in it either in physical format from a game store or for $19.99 on steam. It is a purchase you will not regret.;It starts off with a fairly simple premise. A girl comes home from a year of travel overseas to find the house that her parents and sister live in empty. While this point would probably be a good direction for a thriller or horror game Gone Home takes a slightly different turn.  After exploring the house you gain a number of clues as to what has happened to your family, nothing nefarious I assure you, and the atmosphere of the experience is enough to make you feel like you really are home alone.  The small snippets of diary entries that are your main source of narrative are each compelling enough to keep you properly engaged in the story. The immersion I felt was singularly different from any other game I have played, the minimalist feel of the home and the artful use of sounds made it really come alive.  Some of the themes that you encounter in the game can be fairly deep as well. It isnt just some boring old story that has no depth. Nor does it dump you straight into the deep end without introducing you to the people involved first.  Samantha is easily one of the most interesting characters I have encountered in such a short form game, and I never even really got to meet her. Her story gripped me by the second tape and I couldnt wait to get the next to find out what would happen next.;1906;Over the last few years I have started to play more story driven games with little to no actual action in them. Most are visual novels but on occasion I will find myself playing a gem that is almost 100% narrative driven, while still giving you active control of the character you are playing.  Firewatch was one of these games but Gone Home is the latest. Available in June 2016 for free via the PSN Plus membership I finally decided to sit down and play this game that had been popping up on my radar for the last couple of years.;Difficult to see some clues. Short play time for an expensive game.;48;Astounding soundtrack Realistic narrative. Smooth gameplay;Gone Home, a work of beauty.;7505;67837
1699;Overall the game was fun despite its low budget. It is best to play at a family gathering or with a group of younger kids or older adults who are not hardcore gamers.;This game was good. You walk into a spooky mansion owned by Skelly. Then you find all his or her things. Couldnt tell the gender as it was a skeleton and its voice could have gone either way.  Just like the I Spy books, the game gives you riddles of things to find in a set location. Every location has a mini game or two when looking for things. The mini games are sort of annoying and sometimes a buzz kill. The only reason some could be difficult is the wonky motion controls. That three plate spinning game in the image gallery is one of the hardest mini games in I Spy Spooky Mansion.  Graphics were not god at all. but they didnt need to be. Music and sounds worked.;19844;Before judging this cheesy game, let me say that it is fun under the right circumstances. Its an I Spy game based off the books. Not much too it.;;5;;I Spy the second game;169;69439

1701;;One of the most interesting plots in advenure games Ive ever played! Loved the whole idea. And being able to play 3 different characters makes it even more interesting. It gets extra points for having lgbtqai+ representation;13232;;;6;;Small review;4225;69889
1702;My summary can only be positive for such a simple and thrilling game. The worst part is normally trolling or game throwing players who need to be categorically excluded from more serious matches. Which I hear is happening in the new patch.  I think it is only a matter of time before the more opportunist indie developers copy the concept.;Essentially its a co-operative tactical murder mystery where you are either a clueless majority or a semi-informed minority. The game is balanced to allow either and all factions to stand a chance at winning the game, the winning requirements varying with each respective role you are assigned in the beginning.    As each game starts the player will learn his role and attempt to achieve success for his o her faction by manipulating, lying, truthing, pleading, trolling and otherwise bamboozling the other players. This makes for a very immersive experience that relies on your ability to think and lay down a strategy. An element of luck is always involved, as with any game but often what one layer sees as luck, another has carefully orchestrated to their advantage. Rather like real life.  The game is still very much in its developing stages, with a new patch announced for this month and further patches promised to add balancing elements to the game. It is  free and, of course, they sell cosmetic content.;9658;So what have I been doing for at least a month now?  Playing town of Salem! Saying Free to play browser based coop game is enough to get you lynched in respectable gaming circles but this game has merit. Any game that can suck 100 hours of time out of me in a month is worth a review and this is one of the best little indies that is out there.;Perhaps a little too simple in some areas and viral trolling.;82;Immersive multiplayer, simplicity.;Town of Salem review;198;65172
1703;Had a lot of fun with it for about 20-30 hours;The game doesnt have the greatest story and it steals its combat from Batman like every WB game but it is a fun game to play.  I bought it at $60 so by now it must be less and if you like action games especially ones involving vehicles you cant go wrong;2552;I have no idea what to put here other than play the game lol;Story, batman combat;6;Graphics, vehicle combat;Fun but not very deep;7937;70805
1704;Excellent Hitman game. Excellent game. Wish it had more blood though.;Hitman (2016) is a true successor to Blood Money. Its given freedom back to the player, and now in an even more expansive world. The amount of things one can do inside each level is staggering. Very detailed, and beautifully crafted. Im not a big fan of the episodic nature of the game, but the good far outweighs the bad, in this game.;11157;Casual gamer, but a long time fan of the Hitman franchise. Ive loved every single title (even Absolution).;;6;;Excellent Return to form... and then some!;7949;70900
1705;Complete letdown;I LOVED burnout crash mode which is how they sell this golf game.  Its all about breaking everything in a room.  The problems stem from the fact that there are no golf mechanics.  Its just aim and push a button.  If it were actual golf with a proper swing mechanic etc it could have been fun.   This game just drops the ball (no pun intended) so Id stay away even if you find it cheap... Its just no fun.;18985;;Gameplay is very boring;6;The visuals are good;Sounded fun...but isnt.;7937;71021
1706;If this looks to be your type of game, it probably is: What you see is what you get with regards to game-play (which at times, can be a bit tedious - but such is this case with many of these types of relatively simplistic games) .  The real wonder of this game lies in its dedication to atmosphere and beauty.  So go a head, take a dip and enjoy the mysterious waters of Song of the Deep.;Song if the Deep is not an amazing game, but it is a refreshing game and it is a beautiful game.   The narrative is lovely and easy to digest, as the game follows the protagonist, Merryn, on her underseas , coming of age, quest for her missing father.  The artistic direction of the game, such as its visual themes, voice-over acting, and musical score, are perfectly suited for this modern entry into the side-scrolling 2d genre of metroidvania.  Obviously influenced by the ever-growing genre of steampunk with a not-so-subtle hint of Hayao Miyazaki, it becomes quickly apparent that this little game is backed by a dedicated creative team of designers whom were intent on delivering a beautiful and satisfying, yet simplistic and relaxing experience.;16998;Song of the Deep is definitely not my usual cup of tea.  I usually bathe in violence and gore of sci-fi and horror shooters (from FEAR to DeadSpace), however, i figured that seeing as i have a deep fascination with all things aquatic (i.e. subnautica), i would give this little gem a try.  I am glad that i did.;game-play and controls can be tedious, some aspects of the game itself seem like they might be lacking (however, this may be resolved later on in the game as i have only devoted a few hours thus far);6;incredible artistic direction, all around.;beautiful, relaxing, worth it?;4224;71465
1707;Oh wait... pokeballs are like €1 for 5... well played Nintendo, well played. You needlessly remove the basic original game elements in order to make an extra buck... I hope it works better with the new Zelda game or I will be mailing you the moose shit I stepped in whilst finding NO pokemon in the forest yesterday.  edit: I must point out this review will be quickly outdated since they, no doubt, will fix the servers and bugs as time goes on.  Ill still be a salty cracker then, however.;The popular and vastly anticipated game from Niantic and Nintendo is taking the world by storm. Its release was delayed in Europe (I am currently in Sweden) because they wanted to fix the server capacity. They failed to do that by the time it came out 10 days later. I have, after many attempts, managed to log in three times.    I was reading about peoples wonderful experience further north in Stockholm where wild Rapidash, Charizards and Pikachus can be caught in the metropolis with ease! And why wouldnt a Charizard choose to live in the middle of a city... on my rural farm with rolling forests and sleepy villages however, pokémon must have heard of the glamorous lifestyle and ample opportunities to be had with city life and packed up. Not a single fucking Pidgey was to be found on my morning dog-walk in the forest. Not a Rattata  was found gnawing on the lush fields of barley, not a single Magicarp was found in the crystal clear water in the local river. Not sure why though, is the system based on the population of a local area? in which case I would have to walk about 80km for every 1km a poke-trainer in the City has to walk. And dont even get me started on landmarks and pokéstops.  Thats not even my biggest gripe, this is pokémon yes? Where are the freaking battles? How hard could it have been to make a small battle sequence where you beat the crap out of wild pokemon to make them easier to catch. Thats how pokemon has always worked, why stop now?;12515;For the purpose of fairness I will not be mentioning the several rapes, muggings, accidents and dead bodies discovered whilst playing this game. Although ultimately unfortunate, these things actually boost the games publicity rather than the experience playing it. It must also be said that I have only had the app for about 24 hours and I am yet to catch anything but my starter pokémon. So all in all, this review as well as the game itself is not off to a good start.;It just doesnt fricking work. (yet);39;First effective tool against childhood obesity since the ball was invented.;Not off to a good start...;198;72066
1708;Addictive and satisfying, a rogue-like that makes you laugh and lets you get to the end within less than a lifetime.;Its a beautiful, funny and easy to play rogue-like (turn-based dungeon survival), full of jokes and terrible ways to die. It has options to be played on easier modes than the classic rogue-likes, and has a lot of interesting skills to try, but it is somehow limited on the number of monsters and itens. Playing on easy (non-hardcore mode) you will probably hoard a lot of powerful itens that you will never use, because you wont need it. Playing on hard is the same thing, because you will die before you get the chance. Reading the itens description will provide some laughs. Other than that, its an addictive light-rogue, where you can select the amount of punishment you want to have, so if you are into comical graphical rogue-likes, you may like it.;6743;I finished this game with all DLCs on 23/08/2011 with 27 gameplay hours.;* Not much variation * Lots of useless and repetivive stuff * The final boss is boring;6;* Beautiful graphics * Very funny item ans skills descriptions * Can be played on easy;Rogue-like for non-masochists;8264;74454
1709;Dark sarcastic tone to demonstrate how AI will dominate us all very soon  );Portal is a contemporary version of Chaplin’s Modern Times. The main character is a woman stuck in the machine, but the contemporary machine is no longer constraining the individual through repetitive body movements in order to produce material goods. The contemporary machine plays with our emotions in order to create science. What kind of science? It is probably neuroscience. GLaDOS is not really testing a gun that makes portals. It is testing Chell’s emotional reactions. GLaDOS is fascinated by the human mind the same fashion a taxidermist is fascinated with animals.;71;Ive finished this game on 05/06/2012 with much enthusiasm. This is a first-person action-puzzle-opera.;Some people may find it too short;6;GLaDOS is memorable  The atmosphere of tecnofobia is perfect Makes you feel smarter;Its about technological domination.;8264;74440
1710;One of the greatest games in videogame history.;Portal 2 is a first-person action puzzle that has incredible gameplay, amazing atmosphere and very good writing. It makes you feel terrible, like the first one did, and gives you a glance of how disturbed AI might think.   The dark humor offers a critique of capitalism and techno-scientific domination. Since the game puzzles envolve physics, gravity and out of the box thinking, it is perfect for learning. The editor tools makes it possible to explore level design as a educational experience. The multiplayer mode gives you a whole new kind of cooperative experience.  While some may find Portal 1 to be better, others may consider it as a prototype for what Portal 2 is: a first-person with a memorable story, setting and characters that is only comparable to Bioshock.;72;Portal 2 is the excellent sequel to Portal, a game that is so important to videogame history that it was at the same time cherished by the game community for its innovative gameplay, used in classrooms as an educational tool and featured in art exhibitions for its narrative.;* You need to be able to play it. Cant think of anything else.;6;* Unlike anything else * Great writing and voice-acting * Full of memorable moments;Art, education and good gameplay;8264;74441
1711;Great game, offers a lot, but it is just a first step. The sequels are now a much better option.;Shadowrun Returns is based on a setting that I know and love for a long time. The main campaign has great writing and it feels like it was made for old time fans. But the best idea is the editor. This tool was a dream for people like me, that spent hours creating shadowrun adventures that where never played to the end.  The world of Shadowrun takes some time to understand. It is a cyberpunk future where magic has returned, elves, dwarfs, orcs and trolls, dragons and magical swords get along with high-tech cyberware modifications, virtual realities that you access directly in your brain and self-conscious AIs. The gameplay of Shadowrun Returns is turn-based combat and text dialogues, no voice-acting. Still, the story is worth reading.;3020;As a fan of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG setting since way before playing the videogames, I can say this game is a dream.;* Limited combat and character options * The editor engine is not optimized, you have to buy the sequels to have access to better options.;6;* Very faithful adaptation of a tabletop RPG * Easy to play, also on Android;A great adaptation;8264;74601
1712;Dear Esther is like a mirror. What do you see? I see a man going in and out of the cave, finding hope amid the rubble of his own life. So it was a worthwhile experience for me. It will not be for everyone. But thats the difference between a work of art and an entertainment product.;A man lost within his own world, represented as an abandoned island. As he walks, he studies the traces of his own past, in search for hope. All you do in this game is walking and listening to the narrator. But if you let yourself be taken by the narrative, the experience can be amazing. This game is really special to me, because it helped me think about my own situation of loss and confusion.  The character starts walking on a familiar place, then he finds signs of a something terrible, that left marks on him. He is compelled to walk to another place. On the way, it seems to recite a letter to a woman. He also finds symbols of chemical elements and mysterious phrases.  There are deep emotional scenes that makes you think: Is suffering necessary to find peace?  Dear Esther is an emotional game, it requires patience. Do not expect any challenge. The challenge is to pay attention to details and assemble your own experience from the elements that are given. How much time do you decide to spend in a certain place, looking for a particular sign? What are you looking for? These elements will form the final narrative. So it all depends on you, really.;3082;I love these kind of games. Dear Esther is an interactive poetry.;* There is no challenge, it cant be played as a conventional game.;6;* Amazing deep emotional moments. * Incredible graphics and sounds.;A living metaphor;8264;74662
1713;This game is about second chances. You move from a lifeless place to a garden with flowing life. It is really about coming back to life, so it is another game that helped me recover. It is amazing how this message is there without the need of any word. It is a memorable experience.;Kairo begins with a throne in the middle of nowhere. Youre alone, theres nothing. But nothing becomes something tangible, you begin to think about nothingness. You enter this nothingness, this void, and find many things there. Things buried, forgotten. Other thrones, kings, or perhaps other times of the same reign. But you are the king of a dead and empty realm. Are you alone. There is a world out there and you do not have access to it. There is life, and all you see are images, codes, machines, mementos.  Could the machines drive you back to life? Where does this light leads? Where does this flow leads? Where will you go? Who built it? For what purpose? Where are you really? Maybe in a hospital bed, waiting to wake up. I enjoyed every minute of this trip. I did not understand almost anything, but what I did was enough to make the trip worthwhile.;10479;This game makes me feel like I was inside the dreams of a weird engineer/architect. It is great how it can give you so much with so bare materials. You walk around huge constructions, trying to make sense of it. And then you realize you are the life inside these dead empty endless halls.;* Very easy to get lost. * Looks empty and random. * The above are all part of the experience...;6;* A very trippy and weird experience. * Logical puzzles that you solve without any instruction.;Enjoy with your favorite wine on the table;8264;74664
1714;It is a delightful experience from the beginning to the end. The fact that it is made out of clay, like The Neverhood and The Dream Machine, is a very nice touch too. This is an all-time favorite.;The Swapper presents a philosophical discussion piece by piece, while you solve puzzles by swapping your mind to other vessels, your clones. It makes you ask: What is a mind? Who am I? How do I know Im not a clone that has my memory?  This game is classified as a puzzle-platformer, but does not require such skills. The theme is space science fiction. strange rocks were discovered on a distant planet. When examined, they showed an electro-chemical activity. Some speculate that they may be living, and that they communicate with each other. You can even hear their thinking. In fact, they are one mind, trying to understand the human mind. If you pay attention to the story, you will question the nature of the human mind too.;5892;The Swapper is a game about philosophy of mind, staring Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers discussion over the question of whether consciousness can exist independently of the brain.;* Controls can be a problem.;6;* Philosophical writing made by actual philosophers. * The backgrounds are real. * Challenging puzzles.;Who are you?;8264;74665
1715;If you like games like Beneath a Steel Sky, or games that allow you to immerse in an engaging and deep atmosphere with unique and intriguing stories, you should give a chance to Primordia.;Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game by Wormwood Studios. The main character is a robot with amnesia, but made for a very significant purpose. It is still his choice to fulfill this purpose. He can be a faithful warrior that defeats the evil progressive mind and unites the robots, or he can run away from it. In the game, the robots live under a totalitarian secularist regime, where the belief that the machines were created by a mysterious being called Man is forbidden. His faith in Man keeps the protagonist alive. It is a very interesting twist for the cyberpunk genre.  The graphics are beautiful, as well as the soundtrack. The voice acting is complete and very well done. The voice of Crispin is the best. The dialogues are funny and the developers opted for a more dynamic gameplay, allowing the player to engage in the story without huge dialogues.  One of the advantages is a map that saves the player a good time that would be wasted wandering around. Another advantage is the automatic notes, which saves you the trouble of writing down important information. There are several ways to solve the puzzles, and the developers sought to avoid puzzles that are incoherent with the setting. There is a great internal system for tips, preventing players from getting stuck.;7635;Primordia is a cyberpunk game about faith. Much like in the movie Tron, the main character is a robot with a mission he forgot. A mission given by his own creator, Man.;* The engine is limited.;6;* Amazing setting. * Good writing and voice-acting.;Cyber-religion;8264;74666
1716;Great survival game with beautiful graphics and a deep emotional procedural narrative.;In Shelter you are a mother badger taking care of your cubs, feeding them and defending them from predators. It makes you care so much about your little cubs that you can even think they have very distinguished personalities. Some players have given names to them, and reported interesting emotional responses when one of them died. This game can communicate with a primitive instinct in all of us: the love for the little, the innocent and the frail.  Throughout the game you learn to fear and hate predators as they were monstrously evil. But in the end... They are in the exactly same position you were: trying to feed their loved ones. The threatening predator becomes a loving mother, and vice-versa. And so the game shows how every mother is also a fearsome predator, ready to kill for the most pure and sacred love of all. This alone is powerful.;7832;Shelter is a game about the hardships of motherhood, and so the game truly speaks a universal language.;* Not recommend for immature people.;6;* Simple and beautiful. * Triggers emotional reactions.;The circle of life;8264;74667
1717;The game is very successful on enabling a emotional reaction, especially at the ending, because it builds momentum through interaction with “mementos” from various periods of a person’s life. There is a chance you will drop some tears.;To the Moon is a very different kind of game made with RPG Maker. The main objective of the game is to create an emotional effect, and it is very successful in doing that. It is about finding your way to reconnect with a lost love, even when everything is broken. It is about healing by dealing with memories from the past, and about the sacrifices you do in the hope of staying together forever. It is about something that you said or heard that would determine your whole life from that point on. When you look at the sky and you see meaning in what could be just a set of lights, and you find someone that shares this meaning. It is about the lighthouses we build to find our way home, back to our first love. It is one of the most beautiful love stories I ever heard.  I like the way the game mixes humor and drama together, and gives you simple puzzles in between story scenes. Also, the game adds a lot of interface innovations to RPG Maker.;5025;This is a beautiful game made on RPG Maker, but not a RPG at all. It has elements of exploration, story-driven and puzzle, but the main objective seems to be the emotional effect.;* The engine is very limited. * Some puzzles feel incoherent.;6;* A very creative use of RPG Maker. * One of the best romantic stories you will find.;A game to make you cry.;8264;74668
1718;It is a beautiful game, and it is about people, good and bad people, but also real people. I recommend it for anyone who likes cats, dresses in black, and has no problem dealing with heavy issues. The antagonists are disturbing, mostly because they look so real. And the soundtrack fits perfectly.;The Cat Lady is a bittersweet story. It starts with suicide, anger, horror, pain, violence and despair. But it is all worth. You begin with no empathy for this sad bitter woman with strange habits. She looks like a coward who tried to kill herself, a person with no value. But then, just like it happens with a cat person, you begin to understand her, to identify with her, and by the end, you will even love her. This love is so pure that she becomes a beautiful person  even so she is still the same person. It is a game about loving strange people, which is the same as saying that it is a game about loving people, period.;11270;I don’t like horror games, but I managed to play this to the end, and I’m so glad I did it!;* Gives you nightmares. * For mature players.;6;* Amazing contemporary horror story. * Doesnt scare you out of nothing.;A game about people;8264;74669
1719;Good action for those who like action movies set in exotic slums.;Unlike other games in the series, Max Payne 3 attempts to address social issues instead of the main character’s personal issues, such as police violence, the gap between the rich and the poor and drug trafficking in Brazil.  Here, the rich try to live the American life style, while the poor are slaughtered. Payne witnesses a favela raid and a prison riot, in scenes reminiscent of some Brazilian movies like City of God, Carandiru and Elite Squad.  Even after facing a satanic cult, Max Payne is still surprised by the violence of the Brazilian police. In this game, the police are the real enemy, not the gangsters. The police are involved in the most heinous crimes, with the support of a corrupt politician.  The game features a São Paulo dominated by organized and disorganized crime. A Brazil that worships soccer, where poor people are killed by the police, while the rich are vying with each other through drug watered parties. Is this so far from reality?  There are two interesting characters: the American ex-cop who does volunteer work in Brazil, and the sex tourist. Both sides of the relationship between Brazilians and Americans. But in the end, Payne is the hero. Not unlike any american action movie, after all.;960;A third-person shooter featuring Max Payne and his trademark slow motion action, set in a crime dominated Brazil (not very far from the truth, unfortunately).;* Brazilian portuguese voice-acting kinda sucks. * Challenges are boring to complete.;6;* Great action and graphics. * Multiplayer cooperative mode.;Brazilian police is worse than a satanic cult.;8264;74449
1720;Amazing chance to mix comical relief with theological pondering.;The game starts when you wake up with no clue about his past: you do not know who you are, where you are and why you’re here. You are in an inhabited world, but cannot find other people, only messages of someone named Willie. From these messages, you find your own name, Klayman, and some tips on what to do.  Throughout the game you explore this world, looking for information, but you need to solve some challenges, which are usually memory games. Early on you find recordings of Willie, a being who looks very silly but has awesome things to say, like: “These discs are all that’s left of the true story, (…) once you know this truth, you will know what to do ”.  The story of Neverhood is the biblical story of Creation and the Fall of Man, as told in Genesis, but with a comical twist. Note that the player does not really need all the information he gathers to finish the game. But the idea is that we need this knowledge to know what to do about a moral choice that is presented at the end of the game. We need this wisdom to answer the following theological question: can a creature exercise dominion over creation?  The importance of history is represented by the great wall of memories, composed of 38 screens. Since the character does not run, it takes several minutes to read it all. On the wall are written the Chronicles of Neverhood, the text is a parody of the Christian Bible. It tells the story of creation and the life of the first beings of that weird universe. Imagine a kid that stops to read about 40 pages of biblical-like stories when playing a videogame... But I think the game designers had a good reason. The text is long, but it is the preserved tradition of that world, and explains many things you find in the game, and it is very funny. At the end of the wall you find the message that gives access to your own history. The puzzles often convey a metaphor for religious values, like humility. Neverhood seems to be the denial of two things: paternity (fatherhood) and fraternity (brotherhood).;2164;The Neverhood is a “point and click” game with no inventory or dialogue, made with clay animation and original soundtrack.;* Low resolution. * Controls can be difficult.;6;* Stop-motion animations. * The weird soundtrack is divine.;The end of brotherhood;8264;74670
1721;A first-person shooter mirroring Far Cry 3 in every aspect, but in a satirical and ironical way.;As in the original game, the central theme is simulated violence (including computer games). The mythical element is directly related to television sets and movies. The main ally comes to speak directly about violence and games, repeating the cliché argument that games are a coping mechanism, like any hobby. They demonstrably improve motor skills, problem solving, social interaction and self-confidence. And no study could prove a correlation between video games and violence. Frankly, anyone who thinks that games are bad is an idiot.   The trick here, as in Far Cry 3, is to make the player easily agree with that statement. The game, however, is full of ironic quotations, and this is one of them. Why? Because what the game wants to show you is how we love mindless violence. The game uses action movie clichés like avenging the death of your partner and saving the world from a megalomaniac, but the main idea is that the media is stultifying, and stupidity is often accompanied by violence.  The protagonist makes constant use of dumb puns every time he kills someone. He behaves like a 12-year-old, repeatedly showing impatience with any information that takes too long, even the tutorial. Scientists are called nerds, and the enemies are distracted with 20-sided dice instead of stones. To ridicule nerds is the typical aggressive behavior of a nerd, and this is the catharsis here: the game was made for nerds, it has a lot of nerd references, but it ridicules nerds because, as in the original game, it wants to work as a mirror. The stupidity of the protagonist is not new to the player, it is something that they can easily identify with.  The menus and game tips only reaffirm the obvious, and the game just reaffirms what should have been obvious in Far Cry 3: the critique of patriotism, the immaturity of the protagonist, his fascination with violence, his desire to be the hero and the alpha male, how you are simply being used...  Blood Dragon acts as a catalyst for understanding the moral of Far Cry 3. Here the player can laugh at himself, but ultimately he is the joke.;2001;Blood Dragon is an independent expansion of Far Cry 3 that repeats the moral of the original game, but in a exaggerated and comical way. Its almost as if the creators wanted to make sure the player understood the irony of the original game. All the elements are here, but in a science fiction setting with the slapstick action movie style of the eighties.;* It is just as Far Cry 3, but comical.;6;* Stupid jokes get you every time. * Great conversion of the Far Cry 3 game.;The bottom line of Far Cry 3 for dummies.;8264;74453
1722;The Stanley Parable uses a type of meta-narrative, meta-gaming, to expand the scope of its approach to games. What is the result? An invitation to reflection, in the form of interactive work.;This is the story of Stanley, a person trapped in a surreal world, the world of narrative videogames clichés, with the mysterious narrator as his only ally and adversary .  Stanley Parable deals a lot with the issue of freedom, in games and in real life. We do have the options that we believe to have? To have many choices makes any difference? What if the world is determined in such a way that every choice is actually irrelevant? What if destiny cannot be changed, regardless of how much freedom we have?  These distressing questions are presented in a comic and tragic way during the game. The gameplay is quite different from the conventional first person games, although it uses the same engine as Half-Life 2. There are several possible endings, and at each new end you found out, the meaning behind the game becomes clearer.  You WILL try to do things to assert your freedom, only to to realize it was predicted all along. Theres really nothing that the player can do to get rid of this nightmare, all supposed freedom is only an illusion created to keep you playing. With this, the question remains: Why do we continue playing? The great merit of this game is to consider all these questions and making it sound fun. Turn the criticism of games into a game, and continue playing.;3035;The Stanley Parable is a narrative and experimental game. It features a story that necessarily needs to be repeated several times, though not always exactly the same way.;* Once you are done with it, there is nothing left to do but discussing it with other nerds.;6;* Incisive jokes about the game industry. * You will know the meaning of experimental gaming design.;Fun for the whole family, but only you will get it.;8264;74671
1723;;L.A. Noire features the city of Los Angeles as a prototype for the present cities: a city made for cars, not for people. The city of opportunities (opportunists), the film industry and corrupt politicians. All of this amid the flowering of psychiatry, drug trafficking, property speculation and the American dream.  The protagonist is a decorated war hero who now works as a police officer. During the game, the protagonist is promoted to detective. Along the game you investigate several cases, and uncover a true conspiracy. The noir atmosphere is always present. The soundtrack and the voice-acting is very good.;109;L.A. Noire does what Americans do best: to complain about themselves.;* Still a lot of illogical shooting action.;6;* Innovative gameplay (find clues and detect lies). * You can skip action scenes after trying 3 times and have your partner driving for you. * The facial animations make it look like a movie.;A detective story about the rise of global capitalism;8264;74672
1724;Although I have issues with the game, its still one of the best RPGs Ive played.;The Witchers story surprised me. There are many themes in this game: politics, sex, alchemy, magic, destiny, the holy grail, mutants… I had no previous knowledge of the Witcher universe, but its amazing. Geralt is smart and charming. The game makes you feel like your choices matter, it even makes you feel guilt about them later. Except about the way you treat women, where sexist attitudes are rewarded, unfortunately.  The Witcher is series from Poland, land of my ancestors. They seem to be very proud of this achievement, as the prime minister of Poland gave a copy of The Witcher 2 to President Obama.  The political issue in The Witcher has to do with a religious and military organization that hates non-humans (elves and dwarves, who represent the native peoples). Non-humans in turn are fighting for freedom and equal rights, appealing to guerrilla tactics and resistance. Druids represent environmentalists, helping non-humans when they can. Witchers, monster hunters, represent a small and powerful group of people who prefer to stay neutral, but that ends up being used by both sides of the conflict.  The game has several technical problems: missing information at crucial times, the combat system is bad, but what really disappoints is the sexism in a game that flirts with feminist statements, but ends up being sexist. In the game we see women in positions of power, leading the revolution against oppression, while the old trope of damsel in distress is repeated. Moreover, the sex scenes are presented aiming the straight audience, even when it is lesbian sex.  Geralt is the typical male advocating for feminists, but always with a sexual interest. In the game you can choose not to have sex with every woman you help, but the opportunity exists, and that choice doesnt result in any problem. Geralt defends women from the most fanatical religious and political moralists, but still relies a lot on sexist symbols of power.  Another aspect is the racial and territorial issue. In the game, dwarves and elves are the original peoples, whose lands were invaded by humans. They are considered inferior, untrustworthy, and often massacred in the name of security, though they have superior knowledge, from which the invaders sometimes they take advantage.;80;The Witcher was based on the the Aurora engine, from one of my favorite games, Neverwinter Nights.

1725;I recommend this game for people who like to discuss violence in games. It features anthropological problems, insanity, lots of references, and dark humor. In this game you follow the white rabbit, fall into a hole and get crazy. It’s a game that really deceives and traps you. You end up asking questions about yourself.;Far Cry 3 is first-person shooter with open world features that lets you get the illusion of freedom within a island dominated by a local guerrilla.   Like Alice in Wonderland, which is quoted at the beginning of each chapter, Jason follows the white rabbit, falls into a hole, and finds himself in a surreal place, losing the sense of who he is. His allies are eccentric, he is as lost as a junkie.   The game symbol is the mirror image of a gun. The game tries to reflect the image of the player back to him, showing the absurdity of expecting to be a hero killing countless people.   The game is also about colonization. Vestiges of the Japanese presence on the island tell about the legacy of the atomic bomb, and an agent of the CIA demonstrates an exaggerated patriotism that its comical. The game criticizes the American ethnocentrism, but his main criticism is about the ease with which the players accepts the violence around them.  One of the highlights is when Vaas talks about the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. There are a lot of metaphors about that. The writing is so good it reminds me of Bioshock.;529;Far Cry 3 tells the story of Jason Brody, a Californian who is on vacation with his brothers, friends and girlfriend, knowing exotic places in the South Pacific.;- You are encouraged to kill innocent animals for no good reason. - It tries to criticize violence while exposing you to a lot of violence.;6;+ One of the best writing you will find a first-person shooter. + The game can keep you hooked on its non-stop action.;Alice in Wonderland with guns.;8264;74452
1726;Bioshock Infinite sets the high standard for narrative action games.;Following from the original Bioshock, in Bioshock Infinite we are introduced to the theory of multiverse or parallel realities. Instead of a city under the sea, we have a city in the clouds, Columbia, which was founded by a prophet, Zachary Comstock, under the principles of Christian morality, white supremacy and American exceptionalism. Zachary Comstock is an allusion to Anthony Comstock, American politician who was a famous advocate of political moralism, censorship of offensive works and the prohibition of abortion. In his speeches, Anthony Comstock mainly attacked the anarchist writer Emma Goldman. Therefore, the player is constantly called anarchist. Instead of Emma Goldman, the game features Daisy Fitzroy, a black woman who leads the revolution in Columbia.  The main character, Booker Dewitt, is hired to rescue a girl named Elizabeth.  The central question of the game is: How do you wash the things you did?. Its about redemption from sin, the same central question that drives the religious thought: how to be born again?  Dewitt is full of guilt. He killed Indians in the Battle of Wounded Knee. Baptism is a decision in the most radical sense of the term. It is the decision to die and be born again, to erase the past, to end your debt. But the theory of the multiverse complicates this decision because every choice we make creates a parallel universe that continues to exist. If you choose to convert, at the same you chose not to, which means that the result of your mistakes continues to exist in another universe, as well as the consequences of your sins. Ultimately, your sins cannot  be redeemed.  The same story is repeated in infinite realities. Some elements are constant, and others are variable, but it is the same story happening countless times: There is always a lighthouse, there is always a man, there is always a city. How to prevent these realities to continue repeating? How to truly change history?  Many things in this game reflect the first Bioshock, but in an unexpected way. Rapture and Columbia are two aspects of our society. Both work together and both result in the suffering of innocents. As Elizabeth concludes, these cities are propelled by the abuse of innocents. Here there is no room for children, for authenticity. Even individual freedom seems to be a small price to pay to prevent the loss of innocence, but the loss of innocence seems like an inevitable result of freedom. We can only save the innocence of others, at a great cost, because in our freedom we always end up losing our innocence.  We are stuck in a world where altruism and selfishness tend to complicate each other. You cannot break this cycle, you can only fight it, which at the same time causes its movement and gives meaning to your actions. Individual freedom would thus be closed in a dialectic game in which your self-realization is at once your self-condemnation and your self-redemption. The price of choice is, in other words, trapping yourself on the absence of choice.  Crazy talk isnt it? Considerations like these are the soul of Bioshock Infinite. But you can play just with its soulless body. Just shoot things and go on like you used to. Its fun enough, but it will probably become boring if you are really into the art of shooting people on a screen. Almost nothing of what makes FPS so famous works on Bioshock Infinite. If you play it like ir was just another shooter, you can end up claiming, like some guy did, that BioShock Infinite is the cancer that is killing videogames. And it really is, depending on what you think videogames actually are. If you are expecting a good old and proper FPS where you can just imerse yourself in the lucid dream of performing a killing spree, you will be very disappointed. And the story will also make no sense to you. Ironically, if you were a citizen of Columbia, you would probably be on the antagonist side.;538;Bioshock Infinite is a first-person shooter that focus on the narrative experience, and manages to tackle complex themes such as quantum physics, liberal philosophy, racism, anarchy, american exceptionalism and religious bigotry.

1728;To me it was not an action game with casual narrative moments, but a narrative with casual action moments.;I enjoyed Max Payne 2 like I was watching the season 2 of a TV series: One episode leading to another. The protagonist is a cop that lost his wife and son, then is framed and hunted as a murderer. Anyone who experienced the pain of loving and losing can identify with this. He tries to keep his sanity and kill the demons inside his head. This time, he is not in it for vengeance. Now it’s for “love”, but ultimately to find his “true self”.;19;Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter that feels like a noir graphic novel.;- Too much shooting.;6;+ Great story. + Slow motion.;Interactive graphic novel;8264;74448
1729;This game is a little reminder of how we react to the loss of human lives. Maybe it is not remarkable, but it is appropriate.;I think of this game as a poem about the feeling of human loss in a natural disaster. It tries to make you feel sad about the deaths of people that you never knew, but that had a life just like you have. Theirs stories now told only by the objects that they left behind. They vanished from the world like grains of sand washed by the sea. If you don’t care about this, don’t play this game.  I have no problem calling it a game. The common complaint is that it is “too short” and also “not fun”, and because of that, also “not a game”. What would be the point of making a fun a memorial for the victims of a disaster? And what would be the point of making it longer if it is not supposed to be fun? That’s just insensitive non-sense.;16837;Interactive poem about the Tsunami.;- Not a game complaint.;6;+ Short + Serious;Not a game;8264;74676

1734;If you like to read books, then maybe the game is for you.;I read somewhere that this game was like playing an episode of Star Trek, so it got me a little excited. However it didnt take long before I was disappointed.   First of all, the game is not optimized for AMD, at all. There are several reports on the Steam forums regarding issues with this game and AMD. The developers did reply on a few posts, saying they were looking into it, but that is over a year ago now. I think they have moved on to other games.  I tend to like RPGs where you can read books, tablets, holograms, what have you, in order to get more details about the story and the world you are in. But in this game (which is not a real RPG), it got tedious. Now, you dont HAVE to read anything in order to play the game, but if you want to get anything out of it, you should. The problem is that there is simply too much information. There is too much to read on the computers in the game. It gets kinda boring.   If we overlook the AMD issues, the graphics are OK. I think the publisher is really small with a low budget.;9572;I wanted to like the game;;6;;Not for me..;3999;76035
1735;;This game has mechanics that you will find in other, more popular games like The Division. If you buy this game now, in 2016, youll see what I mean.  The game has a high production value, no doubt. Great music, great sounds, great graphics (Unreal engine) but the controls are somewhat awkward. I only played with keyboard and mouse, so maybe I shouldve tried with a gamepad instead.  The story is interesting, but they shouldve perhaps enabled the players to make their own decisions. As far as I know, there is only one outcome in the game, and the player cant make any story-changing choices.  Easy puzzles, easy jumping on platforms, the game holds your hand all the way. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.;1827;;Controls Lack of influence on the story;6;Graphics Sound Story;Other games inspired by this;3999;70992

1738;;I went into the game with no expectations, I dont usually play stealth games as Im not great at them, but decided to try this out as Ive been pushing through my backlog, and knew a sequel would be out soon. At first, I was into it. The prison and sewer area acted well as a tutorial, and I was learning. Then you are thrown into a smallish sandbox map with lots of collectables, and side missions. It was superb, and i felt great, finding out there was an alternative to assassination was great, and I completed it 100% with ghost and no kills. I was floored, as from what id gathered, most people only considered it good.  The second mission was the same, I loved moving around, grabbing loot, doing side missions, and then I was just told that my assassination targets would be taken care of. A bit shocking but I let it go. Next was a linear map, with no real side quests. I let some prisoners escape and it meant nothing, turning of the lights let me just drop down the building and finish the mission. The mask party was a great idea, but again, the non-lethal option was just letting someone else deal with it, rather than playing a game of intel. Due to my diligence in that level, the next level was a breeze, as I could nearly do the non-lethal as soon as I got inside.  The sandbox maps I so thoroughly enjoyed disappeared as quickly as they started.  Luckily, the level design has not soured my gameplay experience. I was quickly accustomed to moving around the stage and look forward to trying out the DLC and sequel at a later point;533;;- The rest of the game did not feel fleshed out - Non-lethal options left much to be desired - Events can happen without your knowledge (random deaths in non-lethal playthrough) - No defined difficulty curve;6;+First Two Levels made me feel great +Easy to get into +Rarely felt like the game was in the wrong +Interesting characters;Dont Blink;8607;76782

I lost at least 3 hours of tedious mining and warping in total when the game crashes after an intense session without getting out of the ship.

1747;It is a great single-player experience, a game which really should be mentioned more often when talking about Action RPGs.;Apotheon has an unique visual art style which paired with the excellent sound design and music make it an one of a kind game. While the combat system feels very well balanced, the controls sometimes feel a bit clumsy. This together with the steep learning curve might lead to frustration, but by the time you finish your first run, you would have learned everything you need to tackle even the hardest difficulty level, which is where the game shines. This game is not a button masher, the timing and position of each of your hits matter, and every weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. The level designs are good and force you to backtrack and explore, making this game fit into what is called Metroidvania. There is a good level progression with some upgrades and a great variety of weapons. On top of this, there are some great puzzles and a nice story which is supported by a good understanding of Ancient Greek Mythology. When youre done with the main campaign though, you might find that the on-line play is a bit buggy. Lag is a real problem and really limits the experience.

Dont let this fool you, it also gets dark and phylosophical. However, the overall tone is happy and chilled. This game made me laugh way more than it should.  Wait, did I say game? Ah right sorry. This is a kinetic novel, you wont have any decisions in the entire story. So all you can do is read. But that makes it perfect for dead moments in the train or bus stop, since you can download it from your phone.

Simply lacking any unlocking reels, graphics or in-game sequences that make up for the extremely boring environment. You basically stare at a map... for hours and hours. Thats the game. And no, for the history buffs out there, there´s no shaping of history as I expected. I though I would shape history and unlock or see some cool effects after making Italy a superpower or having Poland withstand Whermacht... but no just a simple boring text message window saying bla bla you have now defeated X  and that´s it.

1764;;Persona 4 Golden is a remake of the popular Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4, for PS2.  And aims to tells a story of mysterious killings within a small town. The protagonist arives at the village, shortly before the killings, and has been told by his parent to live there for the next year. After some event, you and a group of friends take it upon yourselves to solve this mysterious and who, or what is behind the event.  The game has 2 main gameplay states. A turn-based RPG, set in randomly-generated dungeons, or a high-school sim where you are tasked with juggling you education and relations.  The first state lets your control up to four party members to take down the main enemies of the game, Shadows, using their unique powers, taking the form of personas. The main protagonist can switch out his personas allowing a lot of variety in how you play the game. And because of this, the battling never becomes too tedious. Depending on your dilligence, the game can shift between difficult and hard, so I suggest first timers take their time to grind for the first 2-3 bosses, or they may find themselves hitting a brick wall.  The second half of the game basically tasks you to map out your life, in order to max out your friendship with as many people as possble, as this will allow you to increase your teammates strength, and make more powerful personas. In order to complete every social link in the game within one playthrough, I had to follow a guide from day 1, and only had 1 weeks worth of leeway. Not only this, some social links are necessary for progression, and some links can be completely locked out.  The game improves on the original by giving more social links, and an additional section near the end of the game. If you do not own a Vita, you will not be missing out on two much, however, this is definitely the preferred version of play.   If you have not played any Megami Tensei games, this is a great introduction to the series. The game is also an essential for for any RPG fan. This game would be considered a perfect 10 if it wasnt for a few reasons which most would call petty. The fact that a second playthrough of the game is necessary to fight the strongest boss in the game, at the very end no less, is a problem, in a story-driven, 70hr game. In order to complete the every social link, you need to take part in an annoying minigame, as well as the fact the first-time players can easily lose the oppurtunity to finish some social links due to story. I have also always had a problem with games that produce time limits to finish tasks, so anyone that does, I highly recommend you search for a Max Social Rank Guide.  Therefore I give the game a Fantastic 9.;2985;;-70hr game forces a second play through for one boss - Spreadsheet almost essential to fulfill all social ranks.;46;-A classic turn based strategy, with no gimmicks, and one that stands up. -Likeable cast -Wide Variety of Play-styles allowed due to persona;Get out the spreadsheets!;8607;83547

Levels have a strange art direction, that feels a bit out of the ordinary, especially since the character stills look great. Gameplay is average at best. You take a top down view attack enemies with a few weapon types. The game revolves around a stamina bar, which means you just end up running around, hit an enemy moving back and waiting for stamina to return. Boss battles reward you for totally ignoring the boss until after theyve attacked, rather than its goal of pushing the player to put himself in danger to attack before the enemy does. Youre only in danger when an enemy damages you more than you expected, and this just becomes frustrating. On top of this you are given a timer to complete areas, forcing you to move in and out of levels multiple times.

It was essentially a pick to win... BUT! Now at 11 hours I have discovered their weaknesses and am using this to my advantage and winning almost every game. My Dota 2 skills seem to have transferred nicely although note that this is in no way a MOBA.  Battlerite is a competitive arena brawler with the dark magic ambience of Dota2 combined with the more casual competitive (jump-in jump-out) style gameplay of rocket league. Games are quick and intense with definite moments of WOW awesome! but can also become a drag when the matchmaking decides to land you with Leeroy Jenkins for team mates. The game runs smooth, looks good in general but the magic abilities and environments are on par with the likes of diablo 3. Fantastic work.  I feel for the first few hours there is enough content to go on, but the development team seem dedicated to very quickly pushing updates which is great news for a game that could expand in many directions. I felt a little annoyed where it seems some of the protection and sniping spells were similar, if not identical among heroes. Some more varied mechanics to shake things up would certainly be welcome and I am in no doubt each hero released will bring an acceptable level of variation.  I imagine I will play on for the few more days it deserves then give it a few months and pick it up again when there has been more content and balancing.;23193;;;;;c;76;83920
1770;;Alto’s Adventure is a port of a popular mobile game by Snowman. It’s all about Alto and a group of snowboarding friends shredding and rescuing llamas. The goal is to go as far as possible, whilst saving as many llamas as possible and performing as many tricks as you can.  The controls are simple, press A on the gamepad to jump or click the screen, the longer you hold it, the longer you’ll flip. As you play you’re given sets of challenges  complete these to level up. They’re not too difficult, a little frustrating at times, but it’s a nice feeling when you finally pull off that quadruple back-flip that’s been eluding you.   The only bad part is that the levels need to be fully finished before closing or you’ll have to redo any challenges you already did. Every ten levels you unlock a new character, each handles a bit differently which helps change up the gameplay a little. The first two are fairly quick, and can easily perform jumps whereas Pas is slow, and needs a lot of room to flip.  There’s not much bad about it, other than the grindy achievements and a handful of one-off bugs the game works well. The achievements are a little frustrating, there’s your run of the mill progression stuff, a few grinds, one million miles, and 100,000 llamas, on release they were glitched, and didn’t function. The devs patched that very quickly, so props to them. However, a decade on the slopes is estimated to take about 500 hours all told, so completionists may want to give this a pass.  All in all, it’s a fun, addictive little game which is clearly meant to be played in small doses on the go, it functions fairly well and has a pretty aesthetic.

The dialogues are very Important in this Game and I dont know how good the englisch dub is.  It has a very strange controls (no mouse) so you have to adapt to it . But if you learned it, you will see that its really fitting to the Game.  The difficulty is pretty high and you cant change it and if you die the Game is over, there are no checkpoints so you should save a lot.  It has a dark medieval theme, so if you like Dark Souls or Berserk this could be for you.;2261;;;6;;My favourite RPG;4946;44127
1779;;Bayonneta is an very unusual game, in the fun sense. It never takes itself seriuosly, clearly aware that is just supossed to give you a good time, which it definitely does. Major points in the style and design parts, since it looks absolutely gorgeous, and the sounds, ambient, and music blend perfectly into one gigantic pile of awesome and great cinematic moments. The story, while a little confusing sometimes, is not necessarly the best point of the game, but is serviceable for a japanese hack and slash. The enemies can get a little repetitive and i would have loved more type of weapons, but what is in the game is very well managed. The movements, combos and style of the weapons are very unique, and feel that way too, and is very satisfying to cut the enemies in your path in very vicious and different ways. The main bosses of the game are another of its main highlights, each one very uniqe and entretaining, and more that a challenge to any player.  All in all, three words come directly in mind when I look back at mi time playing this game: CRAZY FUN TIME, and in the end, isnt having fun what playing videogames is suppossed to be about?;2136;;;;;c;6443;88924

And there are 1 or 2 decision you have to make, that will change the story. + New Game Plus  After you finished the game you can start over with all your abilities and items you already have. + Difficulty  You can change the difficulty in game in many ways, and you get also more experience and *money* this way.  · Leveldesign  It does not change very much. · Perspective  sometimes it can be problematic to see what is above or below you. · Gameplay  It is not bad, but it is very repetitive, but it may change with harder difficulty  Overall it is a really good game.;1983;;;;;c;4946;89206

1789;;Story 9/10 The concept of the game is interesting, it manages to tell a very emotional story based on memory, it knows how to be comical and dramatic when it should be. It also touches on very identifiable issues: that either one can interfere in the life of another person or the meaning of happiness, who would like to fulfill their dreams before dying, even if they were false? Very few games tell a romantic story. There is also no direct exposition, one is watching the story through the scenes and without redundant dialogues.  Characters 9/10 Each and every one of the characters, not very complex but they are very human, with defined personality and very identifiable and queribles.  Narrative 5/10 The work would gain more by being a movie or an animation. The game uses a lot of in-game animations taking control of the character, plus a lot of dialogue. Whats more, gameplay and story are completely separate, unlike Half-Life or Outlast.  GamePlay 4/10 The gameplay is very limited, there are not many mechanics and it is often repetitive, so it is good to last only 4 to 5 hours.  Graphics 7/10 The game shows us a very good detailed Pixel-art, with realistic and beautiful backgrounds. It also gets a great atmosphere for the drama, but it usually goes a little bit, especially in comic scenes, where the sad tone of the game does not clear a bit. The design of characters is decent, besides the animations, although good, there is not much expression on their part for the scenes.  Music 9/10 The soundtrack is beautiful, many songs based on piano, that are perfect in the game and its emotional story. However it is not perfect, in the realm of how it is used, because there are comical moments where these songs sound and a little off.  Final Score 7.1 / 10 If they are people who look for fun and playability, it is not recommended, instead if they are looking for a good, emotional and identifiable story, yes.;5025;;;6;;Emotive;11468;91313

1793;;The game itself is highly enjoyable and is a must-have in my opinion for any RTS fan. I didnt start playing this game until about a few years ago when a friend recommended it to me, I am so glad they did. It is my go-to strategy game to play. After all these years, the game still holds up.  Initially you have 4 factions to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. A typical skirmish will have you face the choice of which route youd like to go in regards to your military.Youll begin a usual game with a Supreme Commander which will serve as your constructor and defender for the opening of the game, from there you can choose to build a land factory, air factory, or naval factory - or any combination thereof. Going down a single avenue approach allows you to spend more of your resources on that particular branch of military.  Getting your factories up to Tech 3 from Tech 1 is a priority as any AI or human will attempt to overtake you with superior units.   As far as economy goes, its a balancing act between mass, and energy. Making sure you are maximizing production while keeping your mass and energy in no short supply. Mass requires you to build mass extractors on specific mass nodes at first, but as you climb tech levels with your factories you will be able to purchase buildings which create mass for you at a high cost to energy. Energy production is fairly straight forward, you build small power generators at first and eventually will be able to construct large power generation structures. Power nodes on the map will give a boost to energy production, but is dependent on the map. Energy nodes are far fewer than mass nodes.  Building units and overpowering your foe with them is not the only way to attain victory in this game. Experimental buildings as well as strategic missile systems can destroy an entire enemy base with ease, given they have not built the necessary counter to a strategic missile system. Overall there are a plethora of ways to win this game, there is no one sure fire way to victory.   One other thing to note about this game is its scale. You can play on maps ranging from 5km squared up to 80 km squared. The unit count is also maxed out at about 1000 units per side. With everything going on, its sometimes hard to keep track of everything going on.  This is an RTS game you really should not pass up, it is a fantastically fun game especially to play with friends. I highly recommend you try it out and see for yourself.;888;;;;;c;11589;92165

1795;;Graphics: 6/10 They are decent, Sonic and other characters look good as the environment, but nothing remarkable compared to games like Mario Galaxy or Metroid other M.   Music 6.5 / 10 It is ... good, has very memorable songs like Let the speed to Mend It or Seven rings in hand, but it is often repetitive, especially for the main theme that is repeated in the menu, when finishing the level or in the Final boss   Story 2/10 It has nothing to do with the universe of Sonic, enter the book of the Arabian Nights? Also appear the characters of Sonic but interpreting others of the Book as for example Tails is Ali Baba or knuckles is Sinbad. The other characters are humans totally alien to the world of Sonic. Finally the story in general is somewhat boring and with inconsistencies, told with cutscenes with almost still images which, again, is boring.  Gameplay 2/10 It is basically a Runner, Sonic always moves forward and you have to dodge enemies and obstacles. The controls are bad, overuse the Wii Control Sensor: to move from side to side, jump, rewind and the Homing Attack, and sometimes does not even respond, so in jump parts or where you should attack a Enemy to advance, not responding is extremely frustrating. The camera is always fixed to be behind Sonic, so if one wants to step back to activate a button, the camera does not rotate, hindering the players vision.  Level Desing 2/10 The levels are almost always straight, with many obstacles in between, very narrow and boring sections, switches in which you have to step back to activate them, added to the above mentioned it makes a very stressful experience. There are few parts where they are well designed and you feel the speed of a Sonic game.  Enjoyment 2/10 It has almost no fun, is stressful, boring and monotonous.  Rating 4.0 / 10 Secret Rings is a very bad game, I do not recommend it to Runner fans, Sonic fans, or anyone with a Nintendo Wii, if you want a good game of the series in that console, play Sonic Colors.;5167;;;;;c;11468;91331

1799;;Ive been playing this game since April 2016.  Ive had both good and bad experiences, as should be expected with any early access game, but my overall experience has been amazing.  I love this game  I love how it currently is (in its ever-evolving state), I love the direction in which its going, and Im excited as hell to see where it ends up in the future.  The devs, contributors, and testers are hard-working and dedicated to seeing the vision through Dondi, the lead developer, has for the game.  Its a hardcore survival game and just keeps getting harder and harder, which Im all about.  I want this game to be as hard as humanly (dinosaurly?) possible, as do many others  I want to really have to work for the dino(s) Id like to play as.  Well, the devs arent letting me down on that front.  Its getting harder (will be even harder later), and I couldnt be more happy about it.  It has some sci-fi elements to it, with the testing on dinosaurs and humans (hypoendocerin, tissoplastic, neurotenic, cannibals), so this isnt a game that strives for realism as the main focus, but the fluidity of the game is realistic imo  you feel like a dinosaur.  You dont have to be a paleontologist to enjoy this game, you just have to enjoy survival and maybe animals.  Im not this way or that way when it comes to dinosaurs  I mean, I like them, but Im not a huge fan or anything.  Rest assured though, I love them now...  I dont care who you are, running around surviving (and dying) as a dinosaur on a beautiful island is fun, point blank.  Recommended.;25838;;;;;c;11732;92925

1801;;The game is a great example of mechanic driven games. Rupees are Tingles health, reward, economy, and main focus of progression. There is one major problem that I could see people running into and that is that the increase is rupee usage/gathering could be a massive problem for those not following a guide. There is little sign posting and there are areas where I could have easily spent way too much, and asked for way too little when bartering. and grinding in this game could be tedious.  A great addition to the DS Library, and I recommend to anyone who wants to try out something new. A best price guide may be an important tool when attempting a playthrough though;11607;;;20;;Greed affects people in different ways;8607;93598
1803;;I love fire emblem ever since I first played on Wii (Radiant Dawn) and have since played quite a few other of the series, all having different aspects that i have enjoyed. Fire emblem Conquest, has quite a few things, for one, the darker storyline coming from awakening is a nice change, and the different objectives and circunstances in the missions made it more varied game. It is quite tough, without a doubt, and if you dont enjoy this types of games, you might get quicly annoyed with it, but finally beating it gives you a satisfaction that you dont get in many games, trying to find new ways to beat the levels, especially the particuraly frustaing ones. The new classes and abilities are nice, although this time around it seems that magic is practically useless and the huge time it can take to form s bonds betwwen characters makes it difficult to get the children chraracters in the right moments, but then again, that challenge really forces you to adapt and change your way of playing. One thing i do have to say annoys me, is the bit much fanservice, even in the localized version it really is much, I know that japanese studios do this to sell more, but really?, considering the deep tones and difficulty of the series, it really seems silly that this is the thing that sellls. But apart from that, and perhaps the fact that there are no really deep meaningful changes depending on the bond you select, the game is excellent all-around, and if you like the series, or challenging strategie games, this is certainly a solid buy. If you like the more streamlined and simpler games of the series like awakening, Birthright seems the better choice.;21863;;;;;c;6443;93621

1809;;ARK: Survival Evolved is a solo or multiplayer game that you can LAN or play online on a server. Personally, I play ARK: SE through steam on my Alienware PC. I run my own personal server where myself and my friends play actively. I was skeptical about the game considering all the mixed reviews but I purchased it for cheap during a sale and I really am glad that I tested it out for myself.   Top 5 Reasons I like ARK:SE 1.  The gave is very immersive which is a huge plus. 2.  ARK is challenging without overdoing the difficulty levels.  3. There is a lot of customization on the gameplay itself within the settings.  4. You can preset up the game to a play style that you, yourself, will enjoy.  5. Ark is a fun game that once immersed into the game you can kill hours after hours playing.  A specific element that stands out is the construction feature, its done in a unique way that isnt displayed in such a manner. It doesnt pull hard on the game like you would expect even when using larger structures.   Problems I noticed with the game are collision issues with the dinosaurs that cause them to become trapped/stuck in various objects within the game world preventing them from being able to move unless the player frees them by destroying the object they are stuck within or killing the dino.   Elements that excited me were the sheer number of skills that you can learn throughout the game, the changing weather and hot/cold effects, as well as the crafter custom recipes.   The element that I feel were dull had to be taming the skill is useful and will have to utilize this feature a lot but while taming there is very little interaction and little that can be done while taming (espically if you are soloing).   Overall ARK is a great game especially if you like to work (or compete) with large numbers of people in a survival aspect / atmosphere.;10239;;;;;c;12192;95656
1810;;This game is smooth, beautiful and already rich in features and functionality. Vehicles work well and all that you expect is there. The more complex features such as AI and building are not great, but this review is being written about the early access version.  Cryengine, finally. Im so sick of unity and bohemia performance issues on solid hardware. This is very refreshing as it ensures fairness in the most important aspect, conflict. When youre shooting at an enemy, you have all the frames and input control over the gun/weapon. The freezes, ticks and lag is not there and you can feel comfortable that the situation is fair.;17379;;;;;c;76;95738
1811;;Short and sweet.   If you do decide to buy this game, you need to understand what youre getting, lest you may be disappointed. Gaming wise, its pretty easy, meaning that you wont encounter any difficult puzzles. Inarguably the best part of the game is the story, which is immersive and there is tons of hidden content and different endings to discover.  I dedicated several playthroughs in order to get all the achievements, since it is honestly entirely possible to beat Oxenfree in under 4 hours. So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.;14587;;;;;c;12238;95749
1812;;The main problem in Ryse is probably its initial nature.  It seems clear that this was focused to be a Kinect game. Its really really dumb combat mechanism, along with a couple of another gameplay mechanics, feel so simple, that it is really hard to understand how they were approved at the start of the development. At least the narrative (but not the story) is well written and presented, along with great visuals.  But its gameplay is so simple, with combat mechanics, corridor-style levels, dumb puzzles...makes an overall mediocre game with top AAA presentation.;3812;;;;;c;11005;95799
1813;;Really hard to get into it but after you do theres no going back. Must be played with friends, otherwise I dont see Monster Strike that enjoyable.

1814;;Before you read, my opinion is maybe biased based on the fact that I have not played a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare 2. So this is my first Call of Duty game in about, I dont know, maybe 5 years, and I have to said that Im really disappointed.  Yeah, the narrative is pretty great, one of the best indeed. But the gameplay felt so standard, unimaginative that I could not find any resemblances with the old Infinity Ward. Its not a bad game or bad single-player. Its just another FPS that no one will remember, either single or multiplayer, unlike previous Call of Duties, Overwatch or DOOM.  So if youre looking for a great Call of Duty, this is it. But if youre looking for the greatest CoD or, the greatest FPS this year, look somewhere else.;18968;;;;;c;11005;96653

1819;;One of the worst games ever made. Terrible writing, no next to gameplay, the visual design ranges from confusing to terrible to lazy. The game chugs along, even if you turn resolution so low that it looks like a computer game from 1993. You can actually do that, by the way, and the Sega CD look of the lowest graphics setting is one of the few charming elements in this title.  The writing is absolutely, absolutely terrible. The game regularly contains poetry, and it is so godawful.  Otherwise, everything is very on the nose, and the only surprises to be had are thrust upon you with no buildup in the story at all up to that point.  Whats really insulting is these people who make the game somehow have their claws so deep in the games industry, theres an ever-present defender of this awful game in the media. Sunset didnt sell well because the industry is UNFAIR toward ART. No, the Industry loves art. See: Walking Dead Series, Beginners Guide, Ico,  To The Moon, Life is Strange. The industry is not fair toward garbage. Sunset is, pure and simple, GARBAGE.;14703;;;;;c;13195;99866

1821;;Uncharted 2 is a great action game, a fair shooter, a mediocre adventure game, and an awful platformer. Weapons feel weightless and unsatisfactory which is sad considering Goldeneye (1997) and Doom 2 (1994) taught the world how to create an AK-47 and a shotgun in a videogame. Exploration is totally absent due to the excessively linear scenarios that even take away from the player the classic left-or-right-path choice. Puzzles are just laughable, take a look at your notepad when prompted and if you can discern forms and colours you will overcome them.  The jumping and climbing feels rigged in your favour, verging on semi-automatic mode. Probably the price to pay for Drakes agile movement, brought to you by the marvellous Naughty Dogs Animation Department, that turns Uncharted 2 action and platforming sequences into truly playable stunt scenes, unlike other games which would simply take control away from you and play a cutscene because what youre about to see is too awesome for us to let you do it.  Artistically and graphically the game is mind-blowing. Be it long forgotten ruins, a war-ravaged town or a tibetan monastery built upon a precipitous mountain chain, the visual spectacle is guaranteed.  The story is adequate and better told, thanks to a cast of great voice actors and sharp dialogue lines that make characters credible and suit the mood that one expects of an adventure film. Uncharted 2 is the best Indiana Jones action videogame ever (notice the word action, Fate of Atlantis excluded). They even managed to include some Nazi reference incidentally.  The game is far from perfect. It lacks on the playability department, but it compensates it with spectacular action sequences, outstanding visuals and a set of characters you do care about.;565;;;;;c;13345;100295

1825;;Graphics: 9/10 The game has sprites that look like handmade drawings, look great, and backgrounds are beautiful. The only bad thing is some animations that could have been better, and give more animations to the protagonist to make it look more real.  History 8/10 It seems to be a simple story, a girl who is helped by two fireflies to escape from a laboratory in ruins, but actually conceals a darker and deeper than it appears. Leave a few ambiguities, but are details not closely related to the main story. His narrative is good, there are few cutscenes, no dialogue, and there is no direct exposure.  Characters 7/10 There are not many characters in the story. Mion, the protagonist, is a simple but realistic character, she feels like a real girl (you show us her past life, her fears). The others are not very deep but have a credible background. I wish they had more time on the screen.  Gameplay: 8.5 / 10 The game does not seek to amuse, it seeks to deliver a message. We control the fireflies and the girl follows them, giving orders like pushing objects, going up or down stairs, activating switches, etc. It also has a somewhat irregular difficulty scale, but it succeeds in being a challenging side-scroller puzzle. In addition, the mechanics of the shadow firefly are creative, but could have drawn more potential.  Level Desing This is very good, each level offers different challenges to avoid making it very monotonous. There are too many switches and doors, which might seem very realistic, but the stage (abandoned lab) gives way to that so its no problem. However there are parts that are very boring and could have done better (* cof * * cof * chapter 4-1).  Sound 7/10 This game has a very good Sound-Track, but does not use it very well. There are places where it is almost imperceptible due to its low volume or is overshadowed by the many sounds of the objects on the stage, so it may go unnoticed, but fortunately it is not always so. I also think that they should have added dialogues or sounds to the protagonist (like Links sounds in The Legend of Zelda) to characterize her more.  Enjoyment 9/10 I really enjoyed this game. Not for everyone but this work shows me that video games can be art.  Final note 8.1 / 10 If you are looking for a fun game, you probably will not enjoy it, but if you are people who want a good story, a challenging puzzle platformer, and / or a game with a message expressed in its playability, it is highly recommended.;20055;;;;;Protecting a loved one;11468;101424
1826;;Inside is an astounding piece of digital art combined with a mediocre game. Almost all of the fun comes from enjoying the sights and the atmospere. And there are a lot of sights. The environments and characters are crafted with such meticulous precision, that you often have to stop and stare at the screen with your mouth open. Its a miracle what the developers were able to do with Unity and how smoothly the whole thing runs.  As for the gameplay, your main task is running right, sometimes with a few twists, until you reach the next simplistic puzzle and repeat. Its worth noting that the running parts take significant amount of time and there are passages where you need to hold the right arrow/button for more than 40 seconds straight without having to press anything else.  The story starts out promising, with subtle hints at whats going on in the dystopian world, but then, after 3 or 4 hours, you reach the end and realize, that the hints were all you were going to get. I found the conclusion unsatisfying and was left a bit disappointed, yet impressed by the insane attention to detail.;7342;;;;;c;8858;101804
1827;;Ive been playing Pokémon since the beginning, and Sun & Moon were the first pair of games in a very long time that made me feel compelled to play it all the way through. Having the island challenge in substitution of the traditional eight gyms felt like a breath of fresh air, and the added focus to the games story made it all that more worthwhile to play.  Game Freak did just about everything right this time around, and it brought me back into the series in a good way. I can only hope the eighth generation can build on this.;18100;;;;;c;1705;102270

1831;;I give it an 8/10. It is my favorite of the whole franchise: good levels, good gameplay, the characters are still well characterized and maintain that charisma, in addition to very good soundtrack. Due to his difficulty he is the best to start in the franchise, although Pirate`s Curse (8.5 / 10) did some things better like: a better story to tell us the past of Risky and Rottytops, see Shantae and Risky collaborate together and The well-designed Dungeons, unlike the Half Genie Hero where there is no right, so I consider Pirate`s Curse the best of the series, and Half Genie Hero the second best.;11078;;;;;c;11468;101417

1833;;Dead Rising 4 was overall a pretty good game however when it came to the ending, it fell really flat.  I thought that once completed I would have been able to explore the open world area but it takes you right back to the menu screen.  The plot even allows for you to continue playing around in the open world area but they dont let you.  Besides that little part, the game was very good!  It was good fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking to cause some mayhem.;19521;;;;;c;7553;180856

1836;;Stories the Path of Destinies is an action game focused on being beated multiple times in order to complete it. Features so many different paths (or destinies, as its called on the game). Based on your choice, you play different stages. The game has, if Im not mistaken, 48 different endings. But thats all. Combat is simple, there are no bosses, there are no cinematics (everything is told you via static screens), there are no puzzles. The only reason to keep replaying stages is your will to unlock new abilities, because the story is dull, simple and without interest.  + Charming visuals - Repetitive. You repeat the stages multiple times, and there are like 4 different enemies in the entire game. - Weird decisions, like no bosses, puzzles or cinematics. - The narrator can be very annoying.;12815;;;;;c;11005;104990

1845;;I really liked this game. Just seeing the characters interact with each other was a really lovely experience. The whole world of Final Fantasy XV was astonishingly beautiful!  The story had its ups and downs though. And the last few chapters were somewhat short, very linear and sometimes quite monotone. In Chapter 13 one was forced to spend hours climbing up a tower with loads of enemies in the way. To get to upper levels one had to collect/upgrade key cards - and that was about it, the rest was just running around and fighting.  The end was somewhat confusing but still good. But the real highlights of the game showed in the earlier chapters (~ before and including chapter 9). One of the best scenes of this game is still the beginning scene.  Dont get me wrong, I still think that every minute of this game was totally worth playing!;359;;;;;c;13595;104902

There is a lot of silence here and moments with nothing happening, but it doesnt make the game boring: it makes Silent Hill suspenseful and frightening. Even with almost 20 years old graphics it looks and feels realistic, cinematic and true. The design, the story, the atmosphere, the soundtrack (especially soundscapes) and somehow even the gameplay - everything is excellent here.;480;;;;;one of the greatest games ever;16377;107092

The game runs great even on now dated PC machines which is another plus. Great atmosphere, sound effects, music and the voice acting is smooth and spot on. Well it should be since it was provided by professional voice actors. Gameplay wise I didnt ran into any bugs. The game was solid in beta and after beta. Its the best free to play FPS game on the market and tbh I would rather play this than any purchasable FPS games. Its that good. I would suggest to the devs making more maps but I bet that with time it will be implemented.;15423;Hmm I thought I already made a review on this. I am pretty sure I did during the beta stage.

1902;;Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment is a fantastic start to the SAO series of games. Originally released on the Playstation Vita, it has found its way to the Playstation 4 Store so now it can be played on the big screen via digital purchase for the very first time. The storyline follows the SAO characters in a time after the Aincrad series ends in the Anime. Players are still stuck in the game world and the game is glitching in various areas. Your task (aside from freeing all the currently alive players) is to find out more of the new hidden area that has been made as well as challenge through the 100 levels to beat the game. Battle mechanics are pretty easy in this real time action RPG and while some may find them repetitive and boring, I found them quite good. Sounds are one of the best part of the SAO games having one of the best soundtracks in Anime history with beautiful music to enjoy while you play straight from the Anime itself. The characters are charming and very likeable though it can sometimes get a bit annoying at how much the female characters (who were strong and confident in the anime) can sometimes be a bit insecure and mopy. All in all however it is worth the play if you are a JRPG fan and an SAO fan.;9618;;;;;c;19980;112995

1908;;Ultima 2 isnt a great game.  I know that.  It probably isnt even a good game.  It is much maligned by fans of the series.  But it was my first, and I love it, and Ill try to defend it in a rational way.  It is probably worth travelling back to 1982 to give it its due.  Crank up some Asia and compare it to games of the day and it doesnt look that bad.  If you played it on the PC you might be confused by why it looks so much worse than its predecessor.  Well, Ultima 1 got a face lift, but 2 and 3 did not.  So you get four color CGA graphics.  (Fan created patches not only fix the game breaking bugs of some releases, but also bump it up to 16 color CGA.)  Every numbered Ultima game from 1 to 9 got a brand new engine, and 2 implemented cities you could walk around rather than view the whole town at once in a different scale.  This opened up more exploration and secrets.  Ive heard fans complain about the setting.  Back in the day you often had to rely on the manual to explain the story.  The reason why the game takes place on Earth is explained, so at least the inclusion of a space shuttle is a little more logical than in the first game.  Also, the time doors that predate the Moongates of future games are borrowed from the film Time Bandits, so there is even an explanation of why different technologies exist in different times.  (As a Rush fan, I hope that the inclusion of Earth in 2112 was no accident.)    So thats my rationalization of the complaints I most often hear.  The actual game?  Id call it average for the time.  Theres a bad guy you have to take out, and theres a unique mechanic for the fight.  Im not sure Id have ever figured out the game without reading some hints, but once you know it its all pretty straightforward.  Increasing your stats is presented in an odd way.  Collecting the gold you need for health, armor, and said stat increases is tedious and slow even with shortcuts.  Getting required items as random drops off of thieves can make getting your first boat or plane really slow.  But being an elementary school kid in the 80s, taking turns with friends, the game had a kind of magic.  So my heart gives it an 8 though my brain knows it shouldnt be.  The true greatness of the series comes later but 2 is another admirable building block on the way.;2868;;;;;c;20451;113908
1909;;Earl Weaver Baseball was ahead of its time, and was a primary factor in making me a baseball fan for life.  I was 11 during the 1986 World Series between the Mets and the Red Sox, and that was the series that got the initial hooks into me.  But it was a computer game really got me.  The lack of games available for my Tandy 1000 made it an easy decision to check it out.  While it was playable with a joystick, it was the depth of the simulation and manager mode that made the game special for me.  Also, it included a roster of real baseball players to manage.  You could have Hall of Famers from different generations go head to head to determine the best of all time.  But the one feature that was most important to me was the ability to add my own players.  Every year as baseball season started, I would dutifully pick up one of the preview magazines with the stats from the previous year.  I would make all star teams of current players to take on the all time greats.  I would take the time to enter entire modern teams and have them face off, managing against the AI.  I doubt there is any game in the last 30 years that I spent more time with than Earl Weaver Baseball.  While all sorts of sports games have implemented manage only modes since then, the simulation stands up even today.  (No one is going to hit 70 homers in a season of Earl Weaver.  I guess they didnt include virtual performance enhancers.)  For that reason alone, I think the game stands up as an all time great.;21554;;;;;c;20451;113896

The classic Zelda dungeon-exploration structure is replaced by a huge open world thats filled with monsters, puzzles, and quests.

1934;;Beautiful and relaxing.  You play as a diver in the ocean and swim through wonderful scenery while learning about aquatic wildlife.  There is a small storyline to follow which leads you through the different areas and ultimately to the games end.  If you want a nice short game that you can complete in an evening and just unwind, this is a good one.;7352;;;;;c;5425;116278
1935;;One of the scariest games out there, it does everything right.  Great story that pulls you in and makes you want to find out more.  Amazing atmosphere - sounds and visuals.  It really knows how to make things creepy without overdoing it.  Having to manually open doors while being chased really gets the adrenaline up. But I love that most of it is exploring and figuring out how to get to the next area.;111;;;;;c;5425;51187
1936;;This is a really neat game that is deceptively simple.  It is part exploration, part management.  The super cute slime creatures produce gems that are used as currency - the rarer or more dangerous the slime creature is, the more the gem is usually worth.  If you bring the slimes back to your farm you must feed and take care of them or else they will escape and cause trouble.  It is a beautiful world and there are lots of secrets to discover and things to do.  Overall it is very relaxing and fun!;16287;;;;;c;5425;116312

1941;;as some one who play the Final Fantasy games from 6 to the 13 i find XV really disappointing in so many ways. the only thing i like is the graphic it was truly beautiful, but even that dont make the game fun to play.  the fighting system was kinda childish, I like the action in it but i hate that no trace of the old rpg games style in the game, and the magic is like using a bomb .. and the summoning . . . (sigh)  story/characters are usually the best thing in rpg games but in XV you wont find any of it, also to understand the story you have to watch other media like movie/anime.  maybe im old but i trully cant like this game at all, hopefully the next FF will be better.;359;;;;;c;8763;100153

1944;;Welkin Road from screenshots may seem a bit unpolished or lacking, but it is a truly fun and challenging experience. It starts off with a fairly simple parkour-esque run and jump through the map to complete the level. A bit like a mirrors edge game without any enemies to get in your way. It then begins to evolve into more of a skill based puzzle as you discover the various orbs and their effects while trying to time your jumps correctly. If you enjoy more action or skill based puzzle games I would definitely suggest adding this to your library.;18684;;;;;c;21944;116748

It was one of only a few adventure quest style games of the era. It required you to type in what action you wanted to do.  Example:  You start outside the house, with a full moon and bats flying about. Youll see a pumpkin on the front porch. Walk up to it and type: Get Pumpkin. Now type Open Pumpkin. Out of the pumpkin will burst a little key. Walk over to the key and type Get Key. Now you can go and Unlock the Door, and the Open the Door. The door will creak open...;8881;;;;;c;21773;117004
1954;;This is the best videogame I have played in my entire life, from PC, PS1, PS2, XBOX 360, XBOX ONE. Nothing (so far) can beat this game. This game is as life changing as a great book/movie, because it is indeed an experience.;6036;;;;;c;22106;117236

1961;;I truly loved it and enjoyed the story, challenging boss fights, intelligent design and the multiple ending system. what really hit my heart was the soundtrack. It brings to minds epic soundtracks such as Bastion and Transistor.;9806;;;;;c;22089;117267

1963;;The game takes a welcome step away from Persona 4. whilst keeping the formula that grew to be the cult hit. It would not be wrong to say that this feels like the game is a step closer to the main SMT line and earlier persona games, with  the re-introduction of persona enemies and negotiation, however, the answers for negotiation seems less random than in previous games. The game is beatuiful and only rarely did I become fed up with the long animations. Social links feel better than ever now that each social link provides noticeable abilities to help with progression, making it harder to decide who to talk to. I think the weakest section of the game would be the palaces themselves. They feel very hit or miss. The first dungeon was an excellent introduction to the palaces, but I feel only one other palace was as well designed. The rest of them either felt like a boring or very tedious, with the last couple having to be done in two sittings (not days, but physical game sittings) which is a rarity at this point. Looking back the introduction seemed to be very drawn out, and it would be a problem not to mention the seemingly artificial amount of time taken away from you by the cat if any story-beats happen during the day.  I would not argue if someone told me that this was their favourite persona game, but I dont think I can say the same. Anyone with a love of RPGs should have this game in their collection;9927;;;;;c;8607;117226
1964;;Katamari Damacy is a storm of originality and Japanese quirkiness. It planted a seed of appreciation for everything Japanese in me. The superb jazzy soundtrack, which was composed just for the game, perfectly complements the silly gameplay that involves rolling up everything into a ball. Literally everything. Starting with paper clips and finishing with entire islands. If I had to pick one game that I consider a true work of art, it would be this one. It has so much soul and originality, as no other game. Unfortunately, the first game wasnt released in Europe, but the sequel (We ♥ Katamari) is almost as good. I dont recommend playing the oter sequels, they are mostly devoid of all the originality.;6453;;;;;塊魂;8858;117271
1965;;Read dead revolver can only be classed as average. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, and whilst it tries to do alot every time it tried something new it only annoyed me, hand to hand combat was poorly implemented and therefore should not be mandatory. Stealth is not a gameplay mechanics and therefore should not have a level built around it. The game lets you play as multiple characters once and then never again. The game seems to be ambitious but never meets its ambitions. The final problems is difficulty. Difficulty rose and fell dramatically in the game  which made the spikes a lot more frustrating after a set of brainless missions.  On the positive side, atmosphere and dialogue are both great.;1969;;;;;c;8607;117422

If you enjoy a solid rpg, a tremendously exciting tale and reading books then this game is for you... and what a world they crafted... Its not your ever day fantasy setting but more a place where dreams as well as nightmares come true. A world where ideas and thoughts rule supreme. I hope youll enjoy it as much as I did.  On the downside, there are some mechanical issues and non-game-breaking bugs but nothing that will steal from the experience, I assure you.;832;;;;;c;4026;117430

1975;;Unique hack and slash/beat em up game. Definitelly best in pre-2000 era. True is that old Tekken or Mortal Combat had more playable characters, but they were lacking deep story, possibility to free roam around (aka simplified open world) and amount of variants or kicks/punches was lower. In Fighting Force you could aswell use any worlds objects (if you had strong character even cars) as weapons. Game also had split screen multiplayer. Single player was also possible to play as co-oop. Game was way ahead of its time.;2542;;;;;c;22333;118430

Still there is so much to tell about such wonderful game, leaving you to discover by your own.  Only 2 things I found this game must includes, ( Negative points against it)   - There is no time feeling  all above happened in one night and there is no morning, noon, evening only night theme and all in one day rainy night, it was great to have player live Batman life like in a month for example with diversity of time periods and weather.  - The game is too poor in sex themes and styles, there should be better to have some erotic missions, sexy girls, adults pictures and some hot elements, that would add to the game a great value of perfection.;5503;;;;;c;14350;118047
1982;;After a hiatus from God of War, I played Ascension. I felt like Ascension doesnt stand up very well against the other trilogy and was left wanting a little more. At first I thought the game looked great, however by the end of the first major fight I realised that the opening shot was a trick. Kratos texture is far more detailed than any enemy or object in the game. Ascension has a couple of fun boss fights but there wasnt enough in between to make me feel invested. The gameplay felt quite different from other entries with only Kratos primary blade and four elements to accompany them. A more balanced gameplay style forces you to dodge and guard more than in the rest of the franchise.   I feel like this wasnt the game to end a franchise on, but as an introductory piece for those who have not played the games, this is a good choice.;1291;;;;;c;8607;119000
1983;;Nice idea. Sadly UI is totally screwed, bad optimization → loading takes ages + always loads cinematics which are not skippable. My average fight was 20-40 tries, thats hella lot of repetitive cinematics.;27274;;;;;c;22333;119103
1984;;Without a joke worst game Ive ever played.  I love games with awesome story, deep characters, multiple story lines. I was so thrilled to play Nier: Automata, because every game review recall those.  But when I started game, I was shocked.  Never seen as much awfull UI as Automata has any game lately. Game menu is worse than being hit by a brick in a head. There is no game settings aswell. Its just low medium and high. And guess what, it doesnt matter what you pick, your settings will be in few hours reverted back.  I love to play games with highest possible framerate (I am one of those human beings who can say difference between 60 fps and 120 fps) and at max settings. Well guess what, Automata has fps lock! Clap clap.  After spending minutes closely checking textures, I can say there is no game optimization on PC. They just shitted it all together with praying that it will work. It is not.  I have few computers just for testing. And on one computer it was running (intro scene with ship fighting) at 11 fps while using 30% GPU load (Radeon R7 370). I dont even want to know how this shit could possibly happen.  Maybe its just me, but fights from graphic side looks meh. Definitelly not a 2017 game.   They say combat system is just amazing. Hah, good joke. Maybe its PC stuff, but controlling all battles feels like go play this shit on playstation, bruh! I am PC player. This shit isnt for me. Boring AF.  I am not much a fan of different gameplay genres, so I will skip criticism on that.  Ive heard how music is so amazing. Like WTF? Its just same three notes melody on loop. Same chords. All. The. Time. Only music styles differs. A tiny bit. Goddammit. How I jumped from a chair when I heard that it has 5 hours OST. Now I understand, its just fucking ctrl+c, ctrl+v. Meh.  And now to the most fucked part of the game: combat. It is soooo boooring. Its repetitive as shit. Enemies are the same. Everything is always the same. It feels like leveling character in WOW for the zillionth time. Loop. Boredom. Loop.  Story is amazing. No doubt in that. Thats a games big advantage.  Funny thing is how many people say that they played Nier: Automata right after Mass Effect Andromeda and how they jumped from shit to absolute hit. Well my experience was exactly opposite. From now on I love Andromeda even more.  If you want aprox 40 hours of agony, go for it. Otherwise, I recommend skipping playing this painfull shit and just checking story on the youtube videos (this one is good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqrMlOUkfc0 ). Most of important stuff happens in video scenes anyway.;11208;;;;;c;22333;119611
1985;;A little rough around the edges at points but generally really fun. Has a good sense of humour and the strategy for combat is barely varied and deep enough for the length of the game. Issues with pacing, seems like for hours your grinding the same stuff then suddenly you power through story beats. Probably only worth one play through but I sank a good 15 hours into that so a good purchase overall.;15931;;;;;c;16595;119959

1987;;Game of the year  TLDR: Game with great story, real life problems and little bit of challenge  ---------------------------------  As a fan of HAWP I found about this game very late and even then it took me a lot of time to pick it up, but damn I dont regret single bit.   True gameplay isnt anything new or revolutionary, but story makes up for it. Never thought I would enjoy story with real problems and, apart from timetravel, is mostly grounded in reality. The thing I disliked most was the cheesy lines, but I can forgive those.  I have to compare telltale games to this, because similarities are obviously there. Telltale games have more choices and they really matter, but life is strange is a bit more challenging.   Its also funny to see how this game has some similarities to Final Fantasies.  -------------------  I think the main messages of this game are:  No one is black and white and life is like a road with plenty of crossroads and any moment is a chance to change it.;7599;;Choices dont really matter;;Story Characters Challenge;c;11741;120202

The learning curve is steep and it takes time to master it and sometimes your survival is pure luck, but when your group is thriving and your base is working like a well oiled machine, it is so satisfying to watch.

1999;;After Four long years of development, tons of bad news and polemics surrounding it, and mixed reviews here and there, does Rime stand our expectations? Well... that is a good answer.  Rime has two mistakes, that in retrospective its only one: it tried to be Fumito Ueda, without being Fumito Ueda. It is a game that wants you to feel emotions and stuff, but the puzzles youll do are not original in any way, and even easy. And thats the main error of the game, its a puzzle game with easy puzzle. Sacrilege! But is that really it? Not to me. My opinion is different. RIME is about controlling a mysterious character, and exploring a beautiful island, trying to uncover what happened there and its secrets. And to advance, there are puzzles. It may sound the same, but it is way more enjoyable playing it with that mindset.  Because even if its linear (another complain I dont get), the exploration pays off. There are many collectibles that go from random stuff, to clothes for our character, to pieces of the story, to related to the throphy hunting... there are many stuff to find, found in alternative small routes, hidden rooms, hidden in plain sight, optional areas... IT FEELS like youre exploring and doing something good. Diving into the beautiful scenery and the amazing OST, instead of the ok-average puzzles and obvious moments made to shock value only.  Overal, RIME is a very good game that I think many people is focusing it incorrectly. But I understand it: the good point of the game comes if you spend your time and explore, other than beating the game asap. Or, if youre not convinced, wait a bit for regular or Steam sales. Also, play it until the end to judge it, like all games.;7621;Grab your red San Fermines clothes and prepare to explore a beatiful Ibiza island on crack surrounded by violins and chorus.

2000;Its funny because META.;This is a story of a person named Friederich.  Friederich was a person that like to spend time in front of the computer, surfing in the internet and doing nothing productive in general. Thats why there were no friends who were going to call they (lets leave Friederich without gender, for narrative stuff) to do stuff. But thats another story.  Friederich spent many time in the site igdb.com. Yes, indeed, they like to surf, watch the next games on release, and watch reviews. One day, they found that no one game was in this page, except of the original Stanley Parable, released in 2011. And then read the review Ah sweet, I wanted to buy this game! by kimono. And they found it very original, and liked the meta comment, so they laughed and found the authors humor really original and clever. They also found the author really handsome, and thought it was justice to give him 10.000 dollars to compensate the tough job of reviewing this game that was not only very good, but talked about videogames in general in a very creative way and, more important, was FREE. So if Friederich wanted could spend they precious money in more important stuff.  Like for example, compensating kimono with 10.000 dollars.   ...    ...   *ehem* I SAID that they spend their precious money in compensating kimono with 10.000 dollars    ...

2006;;WORLD OF COMMANDERS GAME REVIEW  Hello, guys! Ive recently found a pretty cool mobile game and I want to share it with you. Its a war/strategy game called [World of Commanders].   I was never a big fan of war game or games with military concept before, but this one got me. At first, I just started because the blond character in the app icon looked pretty, but soon realized the game itself was very interesting.  There are more than 500 kinds of weapons in this game, and thats not what you can see every day. Weapon system is pretty well-organized. Its made of soldier, tank, artillery, and aircrafts, and theyre divided into small categories like soldier - rifleman, infantry, bazooka team, AT team, MG team and so on / tank - heavy tank, medium tank, cruiser tank and so on / Artillery - heavy gun, anti-tank gun, multiple rocket launcher, field gun, anti-air gun and so on / aircraft - fighter, medium bomber, attack aircraft and so on.    Most of the units are modeled after the real ones actually used in World War 2. Each item has a flag icon that shows from which country the weapon comes from.   The weapon grade is ranged from C to S+. S+ is the highest grade, and C is the opposite. Needless to say, S+ is stronger than C, but its not hard to get high-graded weapons in this game. First of all, it gives you A, A+ and S units when you play the game first time, and you can draw it from draw items they give when you win a battle or level up. Or you can just upgrade a unit from lower grade to higher grade in [Armory] - [Enhance Unit]. Its not a p2w game at all. They just throw items at you.  Also, each type of unit has different strengths and weaknesses. You need to consider the type-effectiveness system to win the battle. For example, tanks are strong against the infantry. Infantry rifleman is strong against fort or bunker. So you want to choose your units wisely before starting the battle. Arranging the units in the right places count too. In the front line, youd better put tanks with high HP, artillery in the middle, and aircrafts in the back because they have strong and long-distance attack ability.    These kind of things make you use your brain and strategies to win. Its challenging sometimes, but thats what makes it interesting. I’m not good at explanation, but you will see once you play the game.  Also, if youre interested in war history especially World War 2, you wont be disappointed. [Campaign mode] provides stages based on historical events happened during WW2. You can read the story, choose the side (between allies and axis) and everything.   You can download World of Commanders for free. - Google: https://goo.gl/C5s3L3 - iOS: https://goo.gl/5L9Fih  They’re giving out free items for 10 days for new registered players right now along with the A~S+ units I wrote above. So don’t miss out this opportunity to own otherwise paid items.  If youre already playing this game, lets share opinions and tips. I love debating and talking about games I love. Thanks for reading!  P.S “Burning Time Event” will soon be held. You can get DOUBLED XP or Credit for battle clear rewards between 18:00 to 20:00 on every weekend of July! (July 1st - July 2nd / July 8th – July 9th / July 15th – July 16th / July 22nd – July 23rd) So make sure you participate!;41071;;;;;c;23592;125167
2007;;Its hard to discuss this game without mentioning any telltale games.  But I can honestly say of this style,  this would not be at the top of the list. If you want to use time travel as a plot device, you need to play it very carefully and this is where Life is strange falls short. Choices became less important (except for maybe 2) as you could check the repercussions of each action, with even a little bio forshadowing events. However, most of them did not seem important.  For example, you are given an option to keep your weapon or get it stolen, however, later on there is an option to get the gun back anyway. You are randomly given the option to have a dog killed, and in the end nothing you do really matters. I also had a strong cognitive dissonance with chloe, where she would do things, or not do things that I felt were in character such as take photos.   In terms of graphics, the game definitely looked better than some tell tale games. I felt like looking around which was good for a game with viewable object and exploration puzzles. Soundwise was a mixed bag, the music was nice but there were often times where you would lose control entirely to listen to music with panning shots. Voice acting worked sometimes and not so well other times.  I also ran in to a couple of bugs with characters not moving or lips not moving, which can take you out of such a story driven game.  Overall an ambitious title that doesnt live up to the expectations.;7599;;;;;c;8607;125285
2008;;An interesting story line with some humor to boot. We all need a robo Me following us around into some underworld.;46926;;;;;c;23771;126365
2009;;Kamiko est un petit action RPG sans fioriture sur Switch, il en a donc les qualités (le prix), mais aussi les défauts, comme un mode histoire quasi inexistant, très court avec ses quatre niveau. Il occupera environ 2 à 3h le joueur courageux.;28015;;Too short Same thing to do at each stage No variety in the action;130;Simple Quick Good Difficulty;Kamiko le test;23783;126458
2010;;Excellent game, an RPG shooter. Its fun to play and would definitely recommend it. You will get sucked right into it.;1939;;Skill tree could be wider and more skills to choose out of.;48;Upgrading armour and weapons.;c;466;126544
2011;;One of the worst racing games money can buy. The Wiis motion controls make this far worse than it was already, though I doubt it handles much better on the PS2. Bottom-tier console shovelware. even if you play it as a joke, its only funny for about 10 minutes until it gets old. Dont play this, please.;5043;;;;;c;618;20105
2012;;This game was made for fans of Saint Seiya, as the game that came before it will cover the following arcs: Sanctuary, Asgard, Poseidon and Hades, as a plus they added the golden kamui related to Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold OVA. The Japaneses voices are original, so if you watched the anime like that youll enjoy, there is not much to say about the game itself is the same thing as the one before but more polished, Ive played to complete the 4 arcs and raise in-game money to buy more characters to play in the vs. mode.;21591;;;;;c;23867;126867
2013;;Not exactly sure why this game exists, or why they called it Pro Skater 5. I mean, people werent screaming for a follow up of Pro Skater 4. And what about everything in between? Underground, the weird plastic board games, etc. The series did basically all it could do by the time American Wasteland came out, which was almost 10 years before this game came out. Clearly, this game wasnt meant to continue the concepts pushed in previous Pro Skaters, nor would it continue any ideas presented in the later games. Its just a bad Tony Hawk game... what were they expecting?;10090;;;;;c;618;33337
2014;;A chill but challenging platformer, with great music and a simple, relaxing aesthetic. Philosophical, but dont expect any accurate astrology. Didnt quite hit the same notes as Thomas Was Alone for me, but still inkeeping with the style of minimalist objects with surprisingly deep characters. The twist of how they change the levels in your second playthough was very clever and well implemented. Well worth the price. A must play for fans of indie games and platformers alike.;11435;;;;;c;16595;127991
2015;;Showing its age now, but a really well made game with a brilliant premise and tight mechanics. It does almost all take place underground and drives home the apocolyptic theme, but dont let that put you off as its so well done.;495;;;;;c;16595;108194
2017;Marvellous by all means.;We all played with plastic army men back in our childhood days, and always wished to re-witness its glorious memories by playing it again on virtual games, here such rare opportunity can be achieved, and I would like to brief out the game main aspects as follows   - Multi-player with diversity of missions with superb visuals.  - Active developers which care about players and keep-on improving with much promising to come. - Perfect game-play, creative ideas, non-repetitive approaches. - Each must try, to add your own experienced points.;15183;Masterpiece, 10/10;No single player story-mode.;6;Missions designs;Masterpiece, 10/10;14350;128383
2018;;This collection of the Sly-series is charming. If you havent played them, you better do it as soon as possible. The characters are easy to fall in love with. In my opinion, the second game is the best one.;7458;;;;;c;24112;128578
2019;;Looking at the trailer makes me cringe.  The kid friendly versions of the animatronic look awful.  FNAF is supposed to be horror, NOT RPG!!  And dont get me started on the fan base.;47068;;;;;c;24198;129141
2020;;A fantastic game that doesnt hold your hand, you must find your own way through Black Mesa. While the game is fairly linear in its design it doesnt give you a marker or objectives. All you know is that you must escape, all the game gives you is when you enter a new area there might be some info lain on the ground or a few words put on the screen. The most the game does in leading you is where, in the few times that it does happen, you have to escort an NPC to a location to help you advance in the game.;231;;;;;c;24286;129872
2021;;Probably the sequel we needed and deserved to the masterpiece that is the original Half-Life. This game has a totally different atmosphere from the first game since this one spends the majority of play time outside and with NPCs. This game does a wonderful job on building the universe that exists because of the events that occurred in Half-Life and its DLCs.;233;;;;;c;24286;129873
2022;;The best things about this game and with all/most Assassins Creed games are the places the player visits and the characters the player meets. While the controls are a bit clunky, especially with the default PC controls, the times where they work perfectly make the scaling of buildings and landmarks an absolute joy. The games story is also great to listen to and learn about with it making you invested in Desmond and in Ezios journey.;127;;;;;c;24286;129874
2023;;The game is just a joy to look at, with beautifully detailed maps and gruesomely detailed enemies that you must kill to survive.  There is really no story here besides what you can find on the maps since this game is multiplayer only. While in most multiplayer modes there exists some form of a learning curve there is barley one here besides figuring out the fighting patterns of the bosses and learning to shoot all enemies in the head to do the most damage. My main gripes with the game is that there are only two bosses with one being way easier than the other and that some classes or perks in the game have far less guns than some other perks.;6748;;;;;c;24286;129875
2024;;My first time playing this game was pretty interesting and I went into it mostly a virgin, having never viewed raw gameplay of the game and at most viewing the trailers and listening to thoughts from friends. While the story isnt the most compelling one ever and doesnt give you a lot to go off of the levels have a decent structure and flow. Besides the story mode there are challenges and endless  the challenges being the more intriguing of the two. In the challenges it has you playing through the story levels again but with new twists and turns making the game more of a challenge. The most fun from this game comes when you play through the levels again trying to get a better time or completing the levels in new and interesting ways.;7205;;;;;c;24286;129876
2025;;This game has a very unique world, atmosphere, and sense of humor that combine with each other to create a wonderful little game. The little is intentional there because the main issue I hold with this game is the length, beating it in under two hours and I thought I was going slow! I would heavily recommend exploring the levels to their full extent at some point, whether during your first time playing or after you complete the story, because they hold a ton of funny jokes and hidden things. I would definitely recommend getting this game when it is on sale because the $15 price tag is a bit steep for the content and length.;24415;;;;;c;24286;129877
2026;;This game, like most multiplayer games, is best enjoyed when played with friends. This fast paced game with a mix of cars, rockets, and soccer will cause you to have a ton of fun while playing. When you score a goal or assist a teammate score one is just so much fun that I couldnt recommend it enough. The game includes a surprisingly decent customization with the you being able to choose the car, flag/antenna prop, the color pattern, and more making your vehicle able to represent you. The developers are constantly updating the game by adding new customizations and game modes for you and your friends to enjoy.;11198;;;;;c;24286;129878
2027;;Boy oh boy is this game really something. The atmosphere is brilliant, it just sucks you into the world that exists in this game and makes you feel like you are in Rapture walking the damp halls. The story also just drags you in and makes you invested to see what happens to Rapture, your character, and the villains/side characters in the game. The great thing this game does is to make you feel like a newborn at the beginning and then like a god/monster (ending depends on the choices you make while playing) at the end of. At the start you have no powers or plasmids and no guns with just a wrench to start, similar to Gordons crowbar from Half-Life. As you progress through the game you can upgrade your guns, health, and plasmids causing you to take and give more damage.;20;;;;;c;24286;129879
2028;;This game looks great and beautifully designs a universe in which the Nazis won WW2 and have taken over the world. The developers of this game do everything they can to fully immerse you into this environment, using music to get you into the mood for either an emotional cut-scene or for full rampage mode in a fight. The characters are also spot on and the developers give you just enough to care about the characters and their backstories without being overwhelmed, the same goes for BJ the protagonist of the game. The varying weapons you can collect and the places you visit prevent you from being burned out and bored of the game.;2031;;;;;c;24286;154947
2029;;A classic in the co-op multiplayer genre that melds enjoyable gameplay and decent challenges perfectly resulting in a game that is a joy to play, especially with friends. The game looks pretty decent even now at several years old and while the levels arent the most amazing in views that have enough detail in them to keep you entertained. There is basically no learning curve except in the multiplayer where all you need to know is how to play the special infected against the human enemies. A nice addition by Valve is the detail in the levels, with the messages written on the walls or the dialogue that the characters say to each other that gives you hints as to what happened. I cannot recommend enough that everyone, on PC, checks out the community workshop on Steam  there is so much content on there like maps, guns, sound effects, character models, etc.;124;;;;;c;24286;129881
2031;;The pvp is pretty good, and even though its side-scroller, I still enjoyed it. There are lots of salty people. Id say its best points are the pvp, the bgm, and the story? Its like an interesting combo of anime, rpg and fighting game. The korean voice acting is much better than the english.;19133;;;;;c;24333;130734

2051;;Im a PC gamer, but for this game I bought a PS3 and it was worth it. The story, the characters, the atmosphere and most of all the changing relationship between Joel and Elli leaves me with such a deep emotional immersion which no other game does it till then. An absolutly must play for all serious gamers. So, I have to get a PS4 and the remastered version too and Im so excited to play part 2 soon. My one and only favorite of all games.;1009;;;;;c;7780;82170
2052;;Good idea. Awesome story. Yet stupid controls and atrocious combat. Also annoying puzzles used as filler.;7603;;;;;c;22333;131205
2054;;Each of Super Metroids elements come together to create one of the most lonely and oppressive gaming experiences ever, and that alone is worth all the respect in the world. Whats more, while its not my absolute favourite game, this is definitely THE best game design Ive ever borne witness to. This game has some of the most clever design tricks Ive ever seen, and Id never have noticed them if I wasnt really looking. The controls are just right but very hard to master, the level design is among the greatest ever, and the minor story parts and setpieces are just unbelievably effective. A masterpiece if there ever was one.;1103;;;;;c;8741;131026
2055;;Finally beat but it wasnt the best way to end this amazing trilogy. Great opening and a MEHHH ending. Glitches and fetch quests leaves a bad taste. Dont get me wrong it is a good game but i hoped for more.;75;;;;;c;15995;131227
2056;;What a cute and enjoyable little game. It isnt the most challenging puzzle game, but as every puzzle game should, it makes you think youve the biggest brain in your neighbor.  The perfect game for a handheld and to kill some time on your daily commute.;15654;;;;;c;15995;131216
2057;;Great twin-stick platformer where your movement is propelled by rocket jumping.   The leaderboards make for great competition as the levels increase in difficulty at a great pace.;18012;;;;;c;23782;131803
2058;;I had this game sitting in my steam account for quite a while before I finally sat down and played it. After I started, it did take me a bit to get into the gameplay. This is just my preference for gaming, but I wish I would have known the mechanic of chaos vs stealth right away  once I doubled down on stealth I really started to enjoy the game, but it took me a while to figure that out. I also found the gameplay wasnt particularly intuitive to start with. But, again-once I figured everything out, I definitely enjoyed the game. My biggest complaint is the ending(s). I found the little cinematic to finish the game was incredibly disappointing, especially since I still have no idea what the deal is with the Outsider  and the game never made me really care that much about who he is anyways. So to have a character whom I dont really care about give me the run-down for the ending  kinda disappointing. Still though, an overall fun game and definitely worth the discount price that you can get it for now.;533;;;;;c;808;131878
2059;;This game! This was the first Telltale game I played, which is probably a bad thing since it has to be the best that theyve made yet for their episodic games. I have played others and enjoyed them, but this game really does come out on top for me. The storyline is incredibly gripping, and really draws you in. What I love is you really feel that you are making an impact on the story as well. This has become one of my all-time favourite games, Im a huge fan. I highly recommend it for those who love a video game most of all for the story.;2993;;;;;c;808;131879
2060;;The graphics were terrible. Even for its time. The music was sort of catchy. But after hearing the same song play over and over again, it began to get stale. The game had several bugs and froze on me quite a bit. However, all the nonsense, I still had fun painting the faces of all the Bratz dolls. And it was funny how the story was very random. Totally worth a try. Not bad if you like to play these kind of games.;3836;;;;;c;169;132361

2063;;The game is alright, it talks about a serious issue, psychosis, however that was worked better in prior titles, for instance spec ops the line. I tried to make the most of it collecting all runes and trying to find all stone faces, the later is interesting lorewise, the former is interesting for the story (but only a small bit, what is really important will be explained regardless if you collected the runes or not) and about norse mythology.  The controls are smooth, the story is meh, there are few battles in the game, but once you get used to the controls (which are few:  heavy and fast attacks, body slams, block and dodging) the battles will be piece of cake. Senua has a good character development - even because she is basically the only character in the game.  Better played with eaphones, hearing those voices in your head makes the experience a bit better.  Its cheap so Id say it is worth the buy.;7603;;;;;c;23867;132454

2071;;Really disappointing. Dull characters, good story concept badly delivered and a morality system that has literally zero nuance. I really liked the first game and this failed to hit the same highs and failed on other levels as well. The controls are pretty good, other than climbing (its fun to shoot lighting at bad guys and theres a good range of abiltiies). But the game really feels like they created a level editor then suddenly realised they had to ship a game with it as well. It just feels lazily made.;515;;;;;c;16595;132668

2077;;Not writing a review immediately as I start playing the game, I have not only Zelda-fanboyish remarks to share about Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I have played many Zelda games in my days and enjoyed almost every moment in each and every one of them. I rate this game fair, both for what it is - a sequel - but Id also say the same had it been a stand-alone game. What is to say positive about the game? It catches the player and forces her to invest time in it. A whole lot of this comes, however, from the fact that you as a player have absolutely no idea of what youre supposed to do. But exactly the same did Sean Murray say about No Mans Sky: that its totally up to the polayer to create her own story. Thats not true in either of these cases.  Most of what I did in this game was to roam around the country side looking for new weapons, as all the previous ones seemed to break all the time. The fact that weapons brake this easily is neither realistic nor does it help gameplay in any way. And whenever I feel remotely good about the only progress I make (reducing the amount of foes over Hyrule) the blood moon rises and resets every foe I earlier had laid to the ground. The story line (or whatever you can call it in this game) can get broken if you go off on your own too early, which I did. And I WILL hold it against the game, and not the console, that momentarily the game can become unplayable due to sincere drops in frame rate, especially during some combats. Any other flaws in the Switchs design, such as connectivity issues, Ill fully leave to the unit itself, but since the game is not released for PC they have no excuse to release a title that graphically cant render comfortably. it happens too often.  Just after a few days gaming I got really bored from it. The shrines are but mere jokes in how they atempt to offer a little bit of puzzle-gaming. One main ingredient in the success of the Zelda genre are the temples of epic puzzles and thoroughly thought-through level designs, and there is absolutely nothing of that kind of play in BotW. Instead, the player is invited to travel over a very non-dynamic but open world and go about everything in her own tempo. Calling this game Zelda, naturally, had me expect a few features that werent in the end-product. I disrespect all 100%-remarks, out of spite to them I should really leave this 0%. But all in all and regardless of any Zelda-francise-related expectations I may have had, Ill be completely fair and - at last - say that this game barely holds up above average. Hence: 6/10.;7346;;;;;c;431;132900
2078;;None of the latter titles under the Fallout series has had me feel so connected to my vault. On my jumpsuit to the halloween party it would most defenitely say 13 on the back. Its difficult to review this game alone, since Fallout2 was released only short after this title and made the original seem like a mere demo of Fallout2. But it was after all Fallout that built the entire Fallout universe and it did just that in the most perfect ways. It felt like a real game, whatever implicated nonsense I could mean by saying just that, and yet it really felt like your in-game choices mattered all thoughout as the most eminent story progressed.  As an old vet of playing pen-and-paper rpgs in my youth, I am also much aware that few others could appreciate the experience of Fallout as much as I have done. But with every attention of theirs to the details (apart from a few glitches, obviously) and truly a genre of its own when it comes to in-game comedy, I might forever hold Fallout on my top list of all times. Still, there were a few glitches and if you dont have the energy to read text this is seriously not your type of play.;13;;;;;c;431;3260
2079;;As soon as I finished Fallout, having wiped my tears, I scurraged to throw myself into Fallout 2. Ofcourse, from just having finished Fallout it was a major set-back to have to down-grade my inventory and my experienced hero. However, Fallout 2 made the set-back truly sting. I can imagine any new player trying to understand the Fallout universe to feel a bit discouraged from starting with sticks and stones, when the box clearly shows plasma rifles -- atleas the tiny pistol you started with in Fallout the original. But as soon as you get out there and find your ways in the world, Fallout 2 shows much more universe than the original Fallout managed to cramp in. Your choices matter to a much higher degree now and almost everywhere you go theres a side to take in some conflict.  The glitches could not be stopped, but quickly patches and mods were released that fixed everything. Or, well, most things atleast. Fallout 2 make you connect more with the NPC:s over the world and this further helped the character development become more difficult. Every role-players best days are shaped by these moments when you get to level up your character, and in the best rpg:s the choices where to spend your characterpoints and which perks to choose are supposed to be difficult. This usually comes from the gaming catching the actual importance of certain skills and/or special attributes in different situations. Fallout 2 catches this very well while presenting an amazing story in an equally grim tomorrow. The typical Fallout humor makes its best in Fallout 2. Sadly, it reaches a point of (experienced) immortality rather quickly. It wasnt long ago you had those sticks and those stones, and soon youll be disintegrating human bones with your futuristic power weapons wearing one of your super power armours. At times (re-)playing this I honestly found the game a bit boring, somehow, but all in all its truly an awesome game and a must play as soon as you finish up the original Fallout. Against, it seems, most other fans I hold Fallout equally higth to Fallout 2 and strongly recommend them to played in order.;14;;;;;c;431;3259
2080;;That is a really cool game, with an innovative concept. The interface is really cool also.;7205;;;;;c;24574;132930
2081;;This game is a really good beatem up, but the difficulty is sometimes irregular. I really enjoyed it though.;7877;;;;;c;24574;132938
2082;;This is a good, yet not so much innovative metroidvania game. The interesting part of the game is that you can play the story mode in coop with up to 4 players. We can sense the inspirations from the game such as Super Smash Bros. and Megaman, but it turns out to be one original adventure.;9383;;;;;c;24574;132942
2083;;You know this game you play on 3AM, after a LAN party ? This is the one, this is perfect !;7589;;;;;c;24574;132965
2084;;Combat is a two-player game where the players attempt to shoot each others tanks or planes. Hitting the enemy vehicle pushes it back and gives the player one point. The game contains 27 levels, each of which has different rules and playing field layout. On the tank levels, the players have a selection of two different mazes or no walls at all, while on the plane levels, the players can choose to play with clouds that obscure part of the screen. The Atari 2600 difficulty settings can be used to change the range of a players missiles, as well as the speed of ones airplanes in levels 15-27. All games have a time limit of 136 seconds.   Combat is an archaic, simplistic game but not the kind of one you rush home to play. It does have a few solid options to play, which they are fun and engaging while you take on a friend. However, unless you are easily entertained, you won’t find this as a title with high replay value.;16759;;;;;c;900;132984
2085;;Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game that provides 27 different settings with some one-player options. On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen. The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics. Unfortunately, theres not much A.I. going on during the one-player settings: the computer just keeps shooting constantly.  Overall, decent fun for two and even a bit more enjoyable than Combat.;11859;;;;;c;900;132985
2086;;Star Ship is a very early first-person space shooter. The concept was very common among late 70s consoles and Ataris execution is not bad in comparison, but its not very impressive either.;18424;;;;;c;900;132986
2087;;Space War for the Atari 2600 was among the first home adaptations of the classic mainframe game Spacewar!.  The cartridge includes two different game modes: Space War and Space Shuttle. Space War is the classic one-on-one game of dueling spaceships and requires two players. The goal is to shoot down the opponent with missiles for one point per kill. Each players ship carries eight missiles and a limited amount of fuel for its thrusters. Once the ammunition has run out, it is refilled automatically, but only if the other player is also out of shots. The controls follow the Spacewar!/Asteroids model of momentum preservation: once accelerated, the ship will keep flying in the same direction until its thrusters fire again. Seven different variants of Space War are available, each toggling different options: the screen boundary is either solid and ships and shots will bounce off, or it can be passed through and the ships and missiles will reappear on the other side of the screen. If hyperspace is available, a player can become temporarily invisible, which uses a lot of fuel and disables the guns, however. If there is a sun in the center of the play field, its gravity will pull the ships towards it and crashing into it will award the opponent one point. Finally, if a starbase is present, ships can fly by it to resupply fuel and ammo.   Space Shuttle is a more peaceful game and in some variants can also be played by only one player. The goal is for the players ships to dock at a fast-moving space module. To do that, speed and direction must be perfectly matched to the module. A successful docking maneuver awards one point. There are 10 different variants of Space Shuttle, toggling one- or two-player mode, solid screen boundary, presence of the sun and whether one or two space modules are available for docking.  Both types of game end after 10 minutes have passed or once a player has reached a score of 10.  Sadly, even for an early video game this Spacewar-port is poorly executed and rather boring to play.;54792;;;;;c;900;132987
2088;;In Outlaw the player controls a gunslinger in the Old West. It features both one and two player games. In the one player version, the goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions.  In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for the player to hide from opponents shots. The player also has the choice of unlimited fire or only a six shooter. If the player chooses the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. Lastly, there is the getaway option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing  without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.  Overall: enjoyable for two players, dont bother with the one player option.;15562;;;;;c;900;132988
2089;;Two aircraft (yours and your opponents) fly over a canyon filled with layers of colorful bricks, a la Breakout. Using the fire button on your paddle controller, you earn points by dropping bombs into the canyon and destroying as many blocks as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.  This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controllers fire button. You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to do the most damage.  The really interesting games modes on the cartridge are the Sea Bomber-variants. In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, using the paddle controllers knob to determine the depth of the bombs. This game is very challenging against the computer and great competitive fun against a friend.  Overall, Canyon Bomber is a cartridge worth having: 7/10;17017;;;;;c;900;132989
2090;;Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is Breakout, and plays the same as the original game.   This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In Progressive the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When theres room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top.   The other two games add a second paddle. In Double Breakout you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In Cavity there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.  Overall, an enjoyable game that does become a bit repetitive after a while: 7/10;12321;;;;;c;900;41040
2091;;Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces. Armed with smart bombs and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants. Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.  While the original arcade-version was famous for its advanced gameplay and sharp graphics, the Atari 2600-port manages to provide only a very simplified gaming experience. Due to the one-firebutton-limitation the use of smart bombs - a key feature of the original game - becomes as good as impossible. The graphics are flickering and most of the time you keep shooting randomly into the darkness. Despite all of that, it was a very popular game on the system back in the day. But by todays standards it is a rather disappointing port.  Defender on the Atari 2600: 3/10;3873;;;;;c;900;132990
2092;;In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.  Warlords is as brutally simple as it is fun! It accommodates up to 4 players and becomes even better with more players! So, round up 3 friends and go to war. Youll be amazed at how awesome and enveloping this simple game becomes. Unfortunately the Atari 2600-gameplay is not as good as the original arcade but still a game you should try on the system.;17251;;;;;c;900;52563
2093;;A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic action-adventure game where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons & Co.) to get treasures.  Adventure is an absolute classic and doubtlessly a milestone in video gaming history. However, not being a fan of the genre, I think that Adventure is not as enjoyable as other Atari 2600 games. Yet, I would recommend to try it out because if youre into the genre you might like this one.;8253;;;;;c;900;132993
2094;;This is a hurdles horse race.There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horses racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively. In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horses racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively. The difficulty switches are not used.  Quite an average Atari 2600 game with rather frustrating difficulty level.;18204;;;;;c;900;132994
2095;;In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.  Fun game, but not addictive. I felt like playing a couple of rounds, but not more.;17019;;;;;c;900;132995
2096;;In this soccer game, each team has one forward, two backs and a goalie. The forward and backs always run in formation. You only control the goalie when he has the ball, otherwise he is computer controlled.  Its a well known fact that sports games usually dont age very well, same goes for this one here. Although not awful, it is a game youll rather skip.;18413;;;;;c;900;132996
2097;;3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is, as the name implies, a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe. The object of the game is to place four Xs or four Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the 4x4x4 board.  Pretty neat but unspectacular game for the 2600: 6/10;11854;;;;;c;900;132999
2098;;Basketball allows you to play a game of one-on-one against either the computer or another player. The court is viewed from the side with a basket at each end of the screen. Using the joystick you can move your player around the court, dribble/shoot the ball, and attempt to block your opponent. The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player. Although very rudimentary, I think the game is actually still quite enjoyable: 6/10;18407;;;;;c;900;133001
2099;;This is a computer game simulation of a miniature golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated. Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit.  Mediocre Atari 2600 game: 5/10;18415;;;;;c;900;133012
2100;;This probably is the only game I likely reviewed. This game is the game that made me crying. You can almost feel the characters feeling and it will also makes you miss Arcadia Bay at the same time. The choices are the best part of this game. Being able to choose things differently really changes the games sensation. And of course the rewind feature is the main idea in this game. In my opinion this game is superb since it relies on content rather than on next gen graphic sh*t. It is a MUST BUY :);7599;;;;;c;24717;133359
2101;;Just re-played this game after 15 years and it still kept me hooked up.;9833;;;;;c;4225;133731
2102;;This game looks beautiful, the style is awesome and the animation technique (Im guessing is at least similar to old hand drawn animation) works so well. They nailed the norse mythology theme.  The gameplay is brilliant with each are and boss having very different individual mechanics. The game has both quite relaxing puzzle sections and intense battles. I died to each boss at least once and had to walk away from the game because of frustration a couple of times, but its so worth the effort the pay off when you beat it is so worth the effort. And theres some good achievements and other game modes for good replay value.;14147;;;;;c;16595;133735
2103;;This game is batshit insane. Every time I thought David Cage was done revealing absolutely mad twists he came out with two more even crazier ones! The plot is ridiculous and ramps up the further in you get, its not well paced and the characters are pretty dodgey to be honest. Basically this game makes most B movies look as tame as a documentary about paper clips. If you like insane sci fi stuff and you can persevere with old akward game mechanics then this is a lot of fun.;25009;;;;;c;16595;133736
2105;;Stories, the path of really really forced and not natural at all destinies is a good game, graphically speaking. The gameplay is smooth but the problem is in the scenario, as you could see in my ironic title...;12815;;;;;c;24574;133823
2106;;I am usually a heavy critic of everything that I know, also Mass Effect isnt exactly my favourite series, however Sheppards trilogy was good enough to make me keep playing it. The story was good, characters were pleasant and even the ME3 ending wasnt that bad IMO.  Andromeda, on the other hand, is really bad, the combat system is good, exploration is good up to a point because it gets repetitive, but we know a game cant rely only on that, plot wise the story doesnt surprise, sometimes it is even meh..., squad mates are uninteresting and some times annoying, the best one is Nomad because it doesnt talk idiocies and can help you get to places.  Andromeda wont be further updated, so dont expect DLC or nothing of the sort, not that the ME series was known for its great DLC content , but they have given up on Andromeda, which is a bad thing, the game had potential, but it went down the drain.;7349;;;;;c;23867;134013

2110;;An intense thriller without heroes, where we play the role of Arris Fern, a social renegade in her revenge against her father, not in the most traditional way, she has a list of people to visit, pretty much like in Kill Bill.  The story is dark, filled with negativity and corruption, the villains end up being victims of the merciless actions of the main character, with lots of plot twists, the writing is spectacular, which makes up for the bad resolution and kind of complicated hotkey system.  Characters can vary, some are good, some are meh, all of them are important for the plot. For example, the depictions of Arris psychological problems are realistic and powerful, while America has nothing interesting to offer except being a stereotypical clingy jealous dbag.  Gameplay wise, it is a stealth action game, aka be silent or youre dead, it works and its fun, however, later in game the player can turn the game into a rambo shooter by purchasing the robot Amaranth.  Pros: Great writing, fun battle system. Cons: Bad resolution, some of the soundtrack is meh.  Final thoughts: Ambitious concept for such a small team with no budget, an intense and dark story worth playing, and its only 3 dollars.;31913;;;;;c;24953;134710
2111;;Interesting game with colorful scenarios and cute characters, I am not sure if its a Yume Nikki fangame, but it kind of reminds me of that, its not for everyone but its quite a nice experience for those who like the genre. Pros: Cool pixel art and beautiful music Cons: Walking sim with vague moments;32219;;;;;c;24953;134711

2115;;So this series will be a bit shorter than the original, having three episodes and happening around three years before Maxs arrival at Arcadia Bay. We will follow rebellious Chloe that dont know how to deal with her fathers death, her best friend (Max) moving away and her mum dating a prick and the mysterious and loved by (almost) all Rachel Amber.  The game is quite similar to the original, with some minor tweaks, the first thing you will notice are the hints on what to do, Chloe has hints written on her hand if you forget what you were supposed to do and, probably the best added feature so far, you can be a smartass with Chloe, in a dialogue you will be given an opportunity to start a debate, with given options you might win or lose a round, there are some fellows that even if you miss one you lost, others you will find yourself in a comfortable position of missing three times.  My personal experience with the episode: if you watched the preview release some weeks ago where we first saw Rachel and people were less than pleased with her, the game kept the same thing, I will try to not judge her now because there are two more episodes and a lot can happen, not only that there is a mysticism involving ravens and Rachel that makes me think that we should really wait to see what they will deliver.  I believe the game will surprise me next chapter, but so far I give it a 7.;29004;;;;;c;23867;135400
2116;;Honestly i didnt like it at all. Played around 8 hours and quit. Mainly because the objectives are confusing, the open world is there but you cant really use it because if you do youll run into stronger enemies who will surround and kill you after 3 hits (wheres the health bar ffs??), this would be normal but it´s not because with your death, the Uruk who kills you is given extra strength. So the game basically discourages exploration. Unless you use stealth all the time, which frankly is not fun at all. Upgrades are confusing and they give you endless button combinations which basically you wont use in the middle of a fight, trust me youll be button mashing in no time. The progression in the story is confusing as well, since there are different narratives which will tie up later conveniently, but story wise this game is pretty much flawed. Theres no obvious objective marker. The map will spawn several objectives at the time differentiating them with colors and basically will let you chose you path, but of course if you chose one different than the main quests timeline, youll suffer the consequences. Theres no logic in the sequence in which you explore the place. Apart from telling that you cant progress in a certain quest if you dont finished another first. This game basically calls itself open world but then cockblocks you everytime you want to do something different. Combat is ok, the Nemesis system should be in the first tutorials of the game, it should emphasize the importance of the system in game early on, and not let you turn a dozen Uruk captains level up until it gives the information that you must disable them or replace them with Uruk allies. But guess what? They are replaced by other Uruk captains. Its never ending grind!  I disliked this grinding system. Some grinding is necessary to level up, but man, the absurd quantity of grinding here is just nuts. How many times do i have to kill those damn archers? Not even Borderlands has this kind of grinding!  I know im being too harsh here, i had some fun with it, but i cant help it. After 8 hours i grew bored and tired of this game and put i away.;3025;;;;;c;9819;135691
2117;;I loved this game, i remember leaving work and run home to play it ahah, the atmosphere and mystery are incredible. The relation between the boy and the creature is touching and tense at the same time. The puzzle are challenging and the graphics breathtaking. The only real problem i had with this was with the controls which ruined entire sequences of the game. Making Trico dive was frustrating as well as other commands. to the point of rage quitting the game. A single but major and decisive flaw in the game, enough to render it from a round 10 to a 7.;117;;;;;c;9819;108333
2118;;Star Crusader is an enjoyable spaceship combat simulator. Its been long time since I finished this game together with my brother and I remember we had a lot of fun. You need to manage the power of your ship in order to supply the ships weapons, shield and speed. One interesting feature of the game is that during some missions you can disable an enemys ship and use the tractor beam in order to steal the ship by jumping back to your base at the end of the mission. Then this stolen ship will be available to be used in future missions.;15566;;;13;;Enjoyable experience;3638;115659
2119;;I was VERY impressed by the first episode of LiS: Before the Storm. This game was made by a different company who gave us fans one hell of a fanservice ride. The game was very warm and familiar, with softer graphics and a huge attention to detail. The story is interesting (we finally see Rachel!) with some heartbreaking twists here and there. Since Max isnt in this story, they replaced the photography with graffiti, which really suits rebel Chloe.   Youll get to meet a lot of old faces, as well as some new interesting characters. I wont spoil it for you, but theres a new mechanic thats really interesting! Music is AWESOME and as I said before, theres a lot of fanservice for true LiS fans. Take a close look at walls and corners where you might find a surprise or two!   I was a bit scared that it would feel different with another company making the game, as well as having new voices. But they really did a fantastic job. It felt like coming home to another story from the same universe, and you ended up wanting to continue the story right away. They also let Ashly Burch (the original voice of Chloe) in on the project, which was a great choice for sure!  Im really looking forward to the next episodes. Great work, Deck Nine <3;29004;;;;;c;3859;135693
2120;;A graphic novel style point and click with a good gritty police drama style. Technically it doesnt really impress, its fine but nothing too flash. The storys pretty cool but doesnt break the mould. I definitely felt like none of my choices had any effect on the plot, which is a big disapointment. Perhaps itll pay off later down the line. Not a must-buy but worth your time.;9080;;;;;c;16595;107538
2121;;This games great. Good art style, good sense of humour, very creepy plot and setting and puzzles that a intuitive but challenging. Im very intrigued and want to see where the series goes. Not sure Id say the replay value is there and its very short, but has a price tag to match. If you like gothic horror definitely give it a go.;18011;;;;;c;16595;136718
2122;;This game couldve been so great. Its basically an insane anime. The combat is deep and unique and the animations are awesome, the characters and plot really grabbed me. But it doesnt explain the combat at all. Its probably got a lot to do with me never normally playing this style of game but I felt like I was battering my head against a wall trying to figure out the combat systems. The bosses have good unique mechanics and are a great challenge, but it was really frustrating since I had no guidance on the nuances of the combat.

2123;;This RTS is amazing in its simplicity. You understand the unique mechanics in the first minutes of game, but it doesnt mean the game is easy. Also, it doesnt even look like an unfinished game.  It is not a game of who spends all resources in warriors to destroy the enemy, but a game of who knows how to manage resources, buildings, territory, happiness, warriors and workers. Your poor management will make you stop growing or even lose progress. This makes the game really fun to play.;18918;;;;;c;4614;136861

2125;;It is a great game.  Do you like Unreal Tournament or Quake Champions? Like Titanfall? Like Overwatch? (I know many players dont like this game being compared to OW, but some elements are comparable)  The gameplay is fast-paced, and sometimes hectic, but it also requires good team play and tactics because of the OW-like elements. If you do not like fast games at all, you should stay away, but if you can tolerate it, and want to give this game a chance, you can play as healer or juggernaut. This way you provide good support for your team.  The sound and music are great. The graphics are great. Core players are welcoming, as they righty should, because we all want more people trying this game.  Regarding player base: Personally, I have never experienced wait times longer than 1mins to enter a game. I play in the EU region.

2127;;A solid, very good game thats an emotional roller coaster as any TWD game should be. Its hard to get into after the emotional ending of TWD season 1, but the emotional payoff after a while is totally worth it.

You get sucked in what is real and what is fake and it is hard to figure what which one is which. The environment is also great. It makes you doubt your own decisions and also makes you want to see things from different perspectives, even when you dont have to. The combats and puzzles are very well balanced. When the games gets too much into your head, there is a puzzle or you to calm down a little bit. When it wants to build up for something, there will be a combat.

2142;Verdict: Pyre is a different type of experience. Its a novel, its a video game, its art in its most modern and purest form. The actual gameplay of the rites never feels stale as the game is constantly mixing it up (whether those changes are up to you or not) and throwing the unexpected at you, mixed with superb sound and music make for a type of memory you wont soon forget. While Pyres biggest downfall is its main driving point, theres not much here that holds the game back, other than minor (or arguably) mistakes. Pyre is a game to play, its a game to recommend to others, but most of all its a game thats well worth your hard earned money. Good job, Supergiant. No stone was left unturned and no shortcuts were taken in the production of what might be your best game to date. Hats off to you.;Narrative: Pyres whole story is based off of a book. The whole entire game revolves around a bible like manuscript called The Book of Rites, which everyone follows without question, it being the perfect guide for civilization. It is to note though that books and reading are against law in the Commonwealth, but ironically, the only people who can lead your team of Triumvarates to victory are the ones who can read the Book of Rites, and those people are far and few in between. This isnt your modern type of game where you freely control your player in an open world environment. Its a point and click style (think of early TellTale) game where your wagon goes to whatever province or region you desire, exploring the Downside and becoming enthralled in the games deep lore and characters and depending on how you play will depend on how your story is shaped so the game and its characters actually reflect on your own skill as a whole. Beware though, this game is not for readers. The games intelligent writing is also its biggest downfall. By the end of the game, I caught myself skipping dialogue and becoming uninterested as I felt the game was dragging itself out towards the end.   EyeCandy: If you know SuperGiants games, then you know they strive for originality, yet familiarity through their titles. If you dont know, the game has a very comfy and warm style of art that mimics styles of smooth pastels and detailed paints. All of the characters and landscapes are highly detailed, bringing them to life. Every region is diverse and feels like its own as even through the artwork you can see the rich history that the Downside has experienced.   SoundDesign: Upon watching the credits (yes, I watch credits, dont judge me) the sound and music is by none other than our award winning Darren Korb. In all of his mutton chop glory he sticks with SuperGiant and delivers the cleanest and crispest sound design that youd only expect to come from a AAA type video game. From the different languages and their dialects, to the believable and high fidelity sound effects, and the nothingshort-of-purely-professional soundtrack, Darren Korb hit it out the park, over the river, through the woods, and- you get what Im saying. For one man to take on the sound AND music for such a big project was something that I found absolutely fantastic. His unusual, but memorable, sense of melody and his always-bending-the-rules type attitude of rhythm creates an unrivaled soundtrack thats good enough to buy on its own. But not only is the music good, it goes hand in hand with the game itself. Every track has multiple layers, and depending on your actions, will depend on what the listener hears.I cant describe music through text very well, but at least to give an idea theres ballads, rock, acoustic, classical, breakbeat, its as eclectic as one would expect if youre familiar with Darrens work. Oh and by the way, Ashley Barrett returns to the studio as well, lending Darren her voice and creating a flawless duo. Their two voices compliment each other like extra cheese on a pizza. Or in a way that is best since... Since... Well I cant think of anything right now, but just believe me when I say this soundtrack is damn good. If you care to look it up, the first track, In the Flame is my favorite.  GamePlay: This is probably the most unique part of the game. Pyre isnt your typical Run N Gun or Hack and Slash. Its a sports game. Theres an orb (just like many sports) that appears in the middle of your field or courtand your team of three have to seize the orb and douse the other teams Pyre. What that means is the ball has to be ran to the other teams side to score points. What I found enjoyable was it was like basketball mixed with football, sprinkle in some dodgeball and you got Pyres main gameplay aspect. Within that formula the game has a host of players that all have a base of four attributes: Glory, Presence, Hope, and Quickness. Glory is how many points your player can score. Their Presence affects how large their Aura is and how close in proximity your adversaries can come in contact with them before being eliminated, Hope is how long it takes for them to respawn, and quickness is self explanatory. And within that your player can either sprint (or slide if its a Wyrm), jump (or glide, maybe even fly), Salute (a polite word for taunt), pass to other players, or cast your Aura which is like a burst of Magic to eliminate your enemies from afar. I say all that and go in a little depth to try and tell you just how deep the gameplay is. With a host of nine characters, all of their abilities are vastly different and their skill trees lead to a unique experience that can truly tailor to anyones playstyle as the amount of plays and strategies one can come up with are almost endless. Be careful though, because once a character is chosen for a certain Rite, theres no going back. I found that frustrating, but I learned to choose carefully pretty quick after that!;18822;Pyre is SuperGiants (developer of the critically-acclaimed games Bastion and Transistor) third little-big game. It starts off with the player being a mysterious outcast clinging to survival in a deserted wasteland known as the Downside. An unorthodox trio of wanderers pick you up along the way as their hopes for a grand plan, that is bigger than themselves, can see the light of day, change the world as they know it, and go against their societys and cultures history in an attempt to rewrite lifelong traditions.;Story drags on Narrative and lore heavy;48;Simple story, deep lore and characters Original and fresh gameplay Outstanding Soundtrack Superb Sound Design;Pyre Written Review;1370;138092
2143;;The first two games were riveting with great pacing and great illusion of choice. Even if there wasnt much actual story branching, you at least felt like you were a part of a living world and actually influencing it. Clementine drove those stories, and you really felt connected to the people in them because of her. A New Frontier throws you into the middle of a family you dont know or care about with obnoxious characters, all of which are not tortured or conflicted like in the first two games, but rather just assholes, irresponsible, or cocky jerks. Theres no one to relate to, and Clementine is barely in the picture. Every time you start to want to get into the story and advance youre thrown into a crappy flashback with no bearing on whats happening. Then there are the sequences that are its time to press X now, well wait. Literally no other option. Just. Press. X. Ugh.   Do yourself a favor and play the first two seasons (theyre great), but avoid this one like the plague.;19000;;;;;c;25224;138125
2144;;One of the most famous games in the crowded MMOBA (Massive Multiplayer Battle Arena) genre., this one stands out as one of the best.  It has a massive (a massive138 champions), a massive and involved story and a fan base that would rival even the most respected games in the genre. Currently, there is 11,500,000 players playing League of legends. Making it one of the most popular video games ever in the MMOBA.  In my opinion the competition is top notch from the bottom up. Youll always have a team to play on and a team to play against and that is saying a lot. This fact alone is what makes League of legends stand apart. The grade of competition is awesome.   The game has a big learning curve that might be intimidating to the causal gamer and as such, I would not recommend this game as a casual game.  Team work is a must. If  you dont play well with others then I would suggest finding another game altogether.  But over all, its a great 3v3 battle arena type game and is one of the top tear games in general. It youre looking for a good PvP experience, then this is the game for you.;115;;;;;c;25692;138122
2145;Horizon: Zero Dawn is not a 10/10, its not a 5/5, its a mess. Its an average game, with unbalanced mechanics. It has redeeming qualities. Every city, or town, felt teeming with life. The survivalist-type game had me feeling like I was using the worlds resources to my advantage. The story revealed itself to be bigger than the main character and the world that she lives in, and it really is truly unique. But all of that does not take away from the wonky camera, the unbalanced grind, the mediocre score and voice acting, the hit or miss parkour system, theres just too many details left skipped or overlooked, and in the end, it showed. Horizon is a game that Id recommend to certain types of gamers. Its not a game to recommend to the masses, or your average gamer, at least in my eyes. Horizon is a game that can take up a lot of your hours as its chock full of side quests and fetch quests. But in the end, its a game I would play if I had nothing else to play. For me, thats the category it falls in. Guerilla Games needs to stick to the FPS genre.;Narrative: The story in Zero Dawn is very cliched. Its about a girl who was outcast at birth along with her father and is on a journey to discover who her mother is. Thats it. Its flat, and if were being honest, so is the characters drive and motivation. Even after the event of you starting off as a child, you help some guy in need (that apparently doesnt age), and like ten years later through some Mulan-esque type training, you become the baddest of the bad and begin your journey on discovering who your mother is. Now I know when I say it like that it sounds uninteresting but believe me when I say it is. But then it gets interesting... The more I played Zero Dawn, and the more the story unraveled to me, its revealed to the player that the story is actually not about Aloys personal journey, its about the world you live in and its history. Horizon: Zero Dawns story doesnt revolve around the main character. It revolves around the people that came before you, and put civilization in the predicament it is currently in. I almost dropped the game because of its boring intro and uninteresting story but because Im the type to finish what I start I stuck with it. And while I think the pacing is a little  on the slower side, it was still a fresh perspective on storytelling that can be appreciated by anyone.    Eyecandy: I would say one of the best things about Horizon would be its very own universe. Its a varied and diversified country that one would expect from any decent RPG containing jungles, deserts, tundras, all those great types of regions. The world is vast and well populated, too. Well, most of the map is desert and snow (or at least where you spend majority of your time) but more or less the feeling of adventure is achieved. Now that isnt to say that the world feels alive. While Guerilla Games did a great job with bringing the cities and towns to life with villagers all doing their day jobs, kids running around, listening to the local gossip, every province has its own people and in that aspect is varied just enough to keep letting you know that other people live in this world and in the end everyone is just trying to survive. The art is great, the models and textures are great, I didnt experience any problems with texture loading, or half-assed sections of the world, but at the same time I cant say that its too memorable. The only thing thats engrained in my brain is the face of Aloy as I probably spent almost a couple hours just looking at her face during dialogue. And I dont mean that in a way like, oh shes some hot redhead and I cant stop looking at her I mean that during dialogue sequences the camera is quite rudely staring her dead in the face while you try and figure out what emotion shes trying to convey because the facial animations and cinematography are mediocre at best. Its very similar to how Mass Effect does theirs. Except the dialogue options you choose bear no consequences. Theyre there for no reason.    SoundDesign: This is going to be the shortest part of this review because theres barely anything to say. Zero dawn scores almost a zero in this category. Explosions didnt sound big and deep, the ambience sounded like a single exported track rather than an amalgamation of the environments sounds acting as one, and the soundtrack was forgettable. Some people would say, well since you didnt notice it, that means they did their job right! I say that when you dont notice something youre paying attention to, that means it sucks. Theres over 80 different tracks on the OST and not one of them earned any type of award as far as Im aware. Now Im sure GGs sound studio worked very hard. Well, they couldve worked harder. Especially on the mediocre voice acting. The cast was horrible in this game and they need a new director. There was probably two characters at most that gave a good performance. The rest? Forgettable.    Gameplay: Finally (*rubs hands like Birdman*). Lets talk about the most important aspect of any game. Lets talk about what makes a game, a game. Lets talk about the broken stealth gameplay, the forced grinding, the menial melee combat, the crappy parkour system, the- ok obviously I had a lot of problems with this game so let me explain. Horizon is definitely not what everyone made it to be. I think majority of people forgive certain aspects of art for an overall feelling if that makes sense. Well I dont. I see video games for what they are so lets talk about this games mediocre ass gameplay. First, the stealth system. This game was obviously made with stealth being one of the main aspects (even though the skilltree adheres to different gameplay types making you think you can play how you want). I call this the Dishonored effect. The game makes you think you can play how you want having all types of mechanics in it when in reality it rewards players for playing how the game wants you to play. I hope that makes sense. Im an offensive type player. Yes, I will do stealth, but more often than not I just wanna go in and beat everything up and then leave. Wham. Bam. See you later. Thats not the case here. If you dont play stealth you wont level up as fast, and you have to grind even harder than you were before and the GRINDING in this game, oh my lord the grinding, is too real. If you like it, cool, nothing wrong with that. Im not a grinder type, when I saw how this game was to be played, I put it on easy (judge me, I dont care). I just wanted the story and didnt care much to explore the world. BUT! And I say, but. This game will FORCE you to grind whether you like it or not. Here I am, playing on easy, level 10, and this game pits me against two level 18 machines with multiple lower scaled enemies. It was unfair, and it was frustrating. I go through all my items, ammo, everything. I was pissed. Here I am, playing how I want and this game legitimately said, Nah bruh you still gotta play how we want you to. So I left the area (putting the campaign on hold) and grinded the hell out the game. Which even then became a mistake because then I became way overstocked on items and loot (which the loot in the game aint nothin) which isnt balanced and ended up having all the best items about halfway through the game. For the sake of redundancy it was an unorganized mess. I will say that you do have to live off the land in this game and Horizon achieves that feel. Constantly foraging, hunting, crafting, it really does feel like youre living off the land. Now if we could get more wildlife than the same four animals (foxes in the desert?) throughout all regions it would add so much more to the game, but I digress. What else is good about the gameplay? The climbing system was super fluid. Way better than Assassins Creed or Uncharted. It was just too bad that there wasnt a lot of it.;11156;Horizon: Zero Dawn is Guerilla Games seventh Triple A title.

This game was a ground breaking hit due to its game mechanic and its story. Every fighter since adopted the 6-button joystick layout. Which is standard practice today.  Graphics at the time was okay, but what really caught the eyes of every player was the story of the two playable characters Ken and Ryu. Theyre were some other characters that debut as boss characters, but I wont say who, you going to have to find out for yourself.

2151;;Superb world building with some of the most unique environments Ive ever seen in gaming. Morrowind may not have the best combat but it remains one of the most immersive games Ive ever played and it accomplishes this by crafting a living and breathing alien world thats full of interesting characters.   Theres a lot to do in this game like the other games in the Elder Scrolls series and the personalities of the NPCs you encounter are even more unique than some of the later entries in the series. This has partly to do with the games dialogue being almost exclusively text with much of the voice acting being ambient. Some may be annoyed by the lack of voice acting but I think it enabled the developers to have a lot of creativity with how these characters are written and also allowed them to write a mountain of text without worrying about the cost of voice acting. You actually feel as if you were talking to an actual person rather than a scripted actor. There is quite a bit of filler NPCs who have generic dialogue but theyre mostly found walking around city streets while the more important NPCs are inside buildings.   Id say one of the greatest aspects about Morrowind is how alive the world feels despite its dated graphics and mechanics. Its clear there was a lot of care that went into building the world. The developers went as far as to give all the races distinct cultures. The Dark Elves (Dunmer) for example have their own pantheon of gods that they worship, gods that many outsiders consider to be evil and destructive. Theres even entire subcultures like the ashlander Dark Elves who live in tribes instead of cities and the Skaal which is a tribe of Nords who worship their own pantheon separate from the Nords of Skyrim. Theres a reason for the existence of pretty much everything in this world.   Now, the now the main story is definitely my favorite in the series by a long shot. You spend the entire game trying to prove to the world that you are the prophesied hero and by the end of the game you really deserve that recognition because you worked HARD to get this far. This doesnt come easy because Morrowind is the most xenophobic province to be featured in an Elder Scrolls game so far. They even have a special term for outsiders in Morrowind (Nwah) so that should tell you how much the locals despise outsiders. Of course you happen to play an outsider and trying to convince them that you are the reincarnation of a great warrior in Dark Elf culture is going to be a challenge. THIS is why the story is so awesome. You dont ever feel as if the world is centered around you. It breaks a lot of tropes you find in fantasy stories. You are the chosen one but you dont have any special ability really to prove it, the only way you can prove it is by completing trials.   This is a game that I think anyone who is a fan of RPGs should try. Its very outdated and that might turn people off but very rewarding once you learn the ins and outs. Theres a reason many of us speak so fondly of it over a decade later.;56;;;;;c;25869;139429

2173;;The first two campaigns are good, but I personally think that the other two are really painful. Leons campaign focus on horror, while Chris campaign has more action elements. The third (Jake and Sherry) goes to the adventure style and, the last (Ada Wong), the worse in my opinion, seems like a stealth/puzzle campaign. The crossover Leon/Chris is awesome for fans. Besides, the relationships between the characters is well developed. However, the game fails as a multi-genre game.;1082;;;;;c;3638;141750

2176;;This here is one of those games with a brilliant core, but where the technical execution reduced the overall score. If it has a high and stable frame rate, reduced the loading times to 1/10 of what is currently is - the game would be an instant classic!  As it stand, the game experience is quite reduced by the technical issues: its hard to move the character, which makes it hard to execute a task, making it almost impossible to avoid mistakes. Sadly you end up blaming the game for the many of the mistakes you do.  Yet the game levels themselves are a bunch of fun - and I keep coming back to it when friends want us all to play something fun together. Overcooked could have been Superb, but instead it tumbles to Good.;51998;;;;;c;6836;142116

2182;;More of the same, difficulty is not that hard so the lack of conscience for AI, Uruks might be able to defend several of your attacks making near impossible to kill them. About the story I guess Talion saves it, Celebrimbor once again showed how much of a douche he is. Gameplay is the same as the first game   Spoiler:  Its a shame that they didnt use Balrogs as much as we have imagined, it was kinda disappointing.   After you beat the main story, where Celebrimbor is trapped with Sauron in its Eye, you will have a post game quest which relies on doing defence of your fortresses 10 times, but it is not ten time in total, is 10 times per quest, sometimes a quest will have one fortress, others will have more and at one point it gets annoying to be doing that repetitively. The only point for those is the secret ending, but nowadays we can see those on youtube.;27421;;;;;c;23867;143168
2183;;Great Creatively but not great mechanically. The game emulates classic survival horror elements such as limiting your ammo, but forces you into encounters. There were too many times where I ended up having to run and trying to punch enemies, and it wasnt scary, just frustrating. Not only does it try to keep ammo sparse but also implements an accuracy for guns, which is horrible to have your limited ammo wasted because 10% of the aim scope was not within the head.    The game looks good and has some great monster ideas, but anyone whos not sebastian have little to know personality, and what they do have come out of nowhere. Not only that but the way you progress was interesting in concept but very tiresome by the midpoint, as there is no sense of progression in what is a 10-12 hour main game.   Creature designs are great but the design is all over the place. There is a new boss monster in every chapter, and there are definitely ups and downs.  Overall this game just felt like a jumbled playground for ideas, and I hope that they will ground this structure in the future because honestly setting the game in someones head is almost cheating for horror, and Id like to see where it goes.;4786;;;;;c;8607;143256
2184;;Its a good game, the combat is a bit different from the first one but quite easy to get used to it, the super heroes story is also a major plus and really funny.

The ending of this game is the same.;11161;;;;;c;23867;143511
2185;;Resident Evil: Revelations was first released in 2012 and it seems Capcom started bring the franchise back to horror. Revelations maybe will not scary you as the original title did back in the 90s, but it will surely make you feel vulnerable and tense. The gameplay sometimes takes you to key moments of the past, when important facts related to the narrative took place, which enriches the story. Most of the time you play with Jill, but you will be in control of other characters during parts of the game. Raid mode is also a great additional of the game. I spent many hours leveling up, trying the get better weapons and making S ranks and Trinity. It is surely worth playing when you finish the campaign. I personally had a lot of fun playing the game and the boss battles were a challenging but rewarding experience. This is an above average game, specially if you remember that the original release was for 3DS, a portable platform.;978;;;48;;Going back to horror;3638;143626

Superhot’s real gameplay exists in those moments where time stopped, and you must carefully calculate your next movement based on a situational awareness of what the enemies around you are likely to do while they can move, too.

2197;;There are two things that lay the foundation for Zelda. Adventure and Dungeons. The game aims to give the user the thrill of adventure but falls short by skimping on dungeon depth for dungeon breadth. Shrines are small and generally lackluster, with a large amount being the same fight against one type of guardian, and the divine beasts sat on the average side of regular Zelda dungeon design, with three having rather similar gimmicks (rotation).    This leads to my major flaw with the game and that is incentive. Due to the lackluster shrines and the knowledge of what I would get for doing them, I ended up ignoring them by the end of the game. Korok seeds are bad incentive for exploring as it is likely you wont be able to use them for most of the game.  It lead to there only being a few times where I was happy after jumping off the main road and I can honestly say that not wanting to explore in a game mostly aimed at enticing me to do so is a problem.   Luckily the world is charming, and characters particularly are good. Although I wasnt a fan of the voice acting, I enjoyed talking to  just about anyone I could and I applaud the translation team. Taking pictures was also a nice addition.  Overall, this is an easy game to recommend as a time-consumer, but there are other games Id recommend for exciting dungeons, and stronger examples of open-world games. This game just may be too much Sandbox for my tastes.;7346;;;;;c;8607;145796

There are a couple of problems with the game that culminate at the ending with a large difficulty spike into a different genre, which I cant imagine many people have completed without cheesing with the help of some charms.

2225;;The game has many things that tell us a lot more about the game series. The plot is very interesting, it has a reason why Bayek does what he does. In my opinion Aya (Amunet) is just selfish. But they both have unique personalities and different reasons on why they want to get back at the order of the ancients. I also believe that the story line is to short. They have been working on it for five years and they said there will be more story line. It is barely longer than the others. I only used the side missions to level up. But apart from that they i couldnt really connect. I could only connect to the ones which had main quest characters because those are the only people that I could make a personal connection with. The  modern day is easy to connect to but is very short. It is left on a cliff hanger knowing that there will be another game with that protagonist. It made me sad to finish the game. I also believe that Bayek is another throw away character but it does leave room for the Hidden Ones to expand. The game in the first update is extremely buggy and is worse than unity. I would wait a month or two for more updates to come out to fix the bugs before buying it.;28540;;;;;c;26614;147190

Just if developers added more gameplay elements and improve their mechanics to have players little more immersed, afterall this is a game not a research project where player only have to google some keywords and reads plenty of lengthy texts to fetch some codes or matching phrases to google them again in long chain which could last for hours.  The game have essential innovative elements, that could develope into great game if for example player have to search in-game world for some texts, pictures, artifacts, codes,... not google them on browser, or deliver a package to in-game lab instead of sending them e-mail from real domain ( which we do every day in real life, and comes at the end of day to relax and escape those issues by playing games ).

I recommend printing the document and having it on hand while you play the game as the difficulty curve goes up fast.

2249;;Dissapointing. After playing through Vanilla Shovel Knight and Plague of Shadows, I had high hopes for the second free character pack. Unfortunately this character overall pales in comparison to the other modes. Specter Knight is a slow character that can climb walls and slice airborne items from afar. The feels heavy and by the end of the game I felt like 80% of my deaths were due to it being buggy. Maps are remade entirely for specter knight and the gimmick feels forced within the map design. Music is remixed but nearly every track is worse, just making me long for the original.  The story tries to be tragic which I dont think fits into the world of Shovel Knight particularly well so I never felt for the characters. The hub this time around is in the castle and is a lot more confined, especially given the lack of map screen.  Honestly it is a step down in every way from plague of shadows, and this seems to be with the choice of specter knight as the character (thanks to a kickstarter vote) and honestly I feel like he would be one of the worst mechanically other than polar knight.  If your not crazy about another playthrough, this is one to skip;23910;;;;;c;8607;149553
2250;;One of the best puzzle games you can get. The game looks gorgeous, and the sound mimics the camping experience. The controls are easy to learn, The puzzles have a nice complexity to them, ranging from easy to tricky, but once you figure out a puzzle youve been stuck on, its incredibly satisfying.   + Having the option to play levels in any order you want is also nice. + Wonderful Graphics and atmosphere as well as simple concept. + Smart innovative ideas, and rich with +100 Levels.;68468;;;;;c;14350;149596
2251;;The French revolution is one great theme. Yet the game failed to take it the correct way. The story has some awesome ideas, but it all seems unfinished, cut in the middle with some believable ending. Same goes for the DLC Dead Kings. Side missions are very repetitive, which is for example compared to AC3 a deep jump down quality speaking. Graphics somewhere looks pretty amazing, but turn around and pixelated tree welcomes you. Back in the day, I was reading in the news how they did create an awesome algorithm for generating public crowds. And today it seems that theyve spent most of the development time on it. Yet this functionality although looking fine is messing with CPU, generating so many bugs, and also slowing you down as a character forcing you to not run through streets and take other ways. So youll evade crowd anyway. And... have I mentioned bugs? ACU is full of them even years after the last patch. Another punch in the face of players was having about 60-70% of inventory full of items that are achievable online only, although theyve corrected it in the last patch. Still, it was there for months. I do not recommend this game. Rather check the story on youtube and go play Syndicate, as it has all the Unity features and more.;5606;;;;;c;22333;150001
2252;;Its an interesting game to play after Steamworld Dig 2, yet its not that good. Id rather suggest second one. This one is missing good UI and the easy way to travel around, teleports are pricy and even one death is a problem because even if you collect everything, youll be missing necessary gold for every improvement at the end. On the other way, the boss at the ending is not that difficult.;5772;;;;;c;22333;150058
2253;;In my memory, Full Throttle was one of the first games Ive played in my life, when I was about 8 years old in 1996. Needless to say how the game stuck in my memory because, 20 years later, I can finish it with only 4 hours of gameplay, reminding me of all the solutions of the puzzles.  Full Throttle is a simple game, perhaps the easiest of the point-and-click generation of the 90s. Worries about delivering a good story involving the Polecats biker gang who ends up engaging in a hostile takeover at Corley Motors. With an excellent gameplay, with motorcycle gang fights on Mine Road and crossing a minefield with toy rabbits, the game also has a great soundtrack and memorable characters such as Maureen and Father Torque.  When I think about the beginning of my passion for video games, one of the images that soon comes to my mind is Ben riding his bike.;180;;;;;c;24635;150323

2261;;After a long time of hearing discussions and reading articles, I finally got the chance to play this game. Play? Well, more like experienced it.  In case you never heard about this game heres a brief description:  A video game developers love letter to his son  an immersive narrative driven experience to memorialize Joel Green and, through his story, honor the many he represents. That Dragon, Cancer is a poetic and playful interactive retelling of Joels 4-year fight against cancer.  Using a mix of first-person and third-person perspective, and point-and-click interaction, this two -hour narrative experience invites the player to slow down and immerse themselves in a deeply personal memoir featuring audio taken from home videos, spoken word poetry , and themes of faith, hope, despair, helplessness and love.  That Dragon, Cancer sounded like a game that will make me sad and depressed, but it never happened. The reason is because its execution was underwhelming. Sure, the story is a tragedy, however its not enough to show a difficult (almost impossible) scenario like the one the game presents to us. You can say that most of the dialogues and the scenes are metaphors, but they never got me immersed the way I expected them to be (except when baby Joel was screaming and crying endlessly, which made me uncomfortable for a whole 5 minutes). The gameplay itself doesnt feel natural at all. Again, you can argue and say that this game wasnt meant to be fun, but only to be an interactive experience. Still, the mini games and the interaction itself was the same as a broken game.  Do I make it sound like I am a heartless bastard who only wants to have fun games with top notch graphics? Then you got the wrong impression. I know the story is heartbreaking and I know there was a better way to tell it than in a video game that barely resembles the emotional wreck the family experienced.;15925;;;;;c;9387;151350
2262;;Game of the year 2016 - Playtime 77 hours  If you like fun and want to have it with friends and friendly people, this is the game.   This something we need in a world dominated by overly competitive games like League of Legends or Overwatch. Game that is just fun to play and makes you laugh instead of hating everyone and stressing out.  What makes this stand out from other games with map editors is that maps are made fast with impulse.   Though there are errors, bugs and glitches, but most of them are rare or tiny. But developers seem like they havent abandoned the game like it happens many times with these type of games.;18158;;;;;c;11741;151355
2263;Took me sometime to get hooked into, but when I did I loved it for it story and engaging battles;Game of the year 2015  Maybe best game ever like you havent heard this said before. Anyway I played this only recently this summer. I knew about the hype, I had even bought the game, but I hadnt picked it up. It took me a while to get into it even when I started playing it. Second play through (First play through I didnt even complete it) in the middle of it I got sucked into the game.  When a game has a good story the game itself isnt so engaging, but this is an exception. The battle system is something amazing, it made turn based battle fun and unique, not like in Final Fantasy where it is mostly repetitive and boring.  But it shines with story, I like almost every character. And for a first time in a RPG I cared about the NPCs which is also an achievement.  Music is also great. About 10 songs stuck in my head from the soundtrack.  Its a story about determination, forgiveness and friendship.;12517;;My only gripe is that the protagonist is silent...

2266;;This is a game I can fully say I respect.  The game is about confusing as it gets,  the player is tasked with unlocking the secrets of the ruins using glyphs scattered around the many sections, and it does not pull punches, with an un-quiet environment, brain-boggling  puzzles, and and difficult gameplay. This game sits among the best as both a puzzle platformer and metroidvania. With this and cave story, I wonder how many hidden gems are tucked away within the japanese indie scene.;7936;;;;;c;8607;151684
2267;;What can I even say about Bloodborne?  Im not the type of person to give anything a perfect score. Often, I consider it sacrilege to imply that anything is perfection, as I dont think a state of pure perfection can exist. Surprisingly enough, despite this, FromSoftware managed to deliver so hard with Bloodborne that I had to forget about that assumption entirely.  From the brooding macabre aesthetic to the sheer incredible atmosphere, FromSoft has crafted a world that you cant help but Jones to explore. Sure, it uses typical horror tropes and ideas that we are accustomed to: werewolf-like citizens in various states of transformation, a Lovecraftian inspired horror that bleeds into and creepifies everything, dark and twisted themes that inspire gross-out reactions, but it twists them in such a unique way that one cant help but be appalled. Ive always been a big fan of how FromSoft likes to show rather than tell you the story, leaving clues all over the game world that hint at what happened but still leaving much open to player interpretation. This leads to a much more aware sense while playing, as the player will find themselves paying closer attention to just about everything in the search for answers, including such things we often take for granted and typically ignore in other titles. Level location architecture or various in-game art assets can create wild speculation for the most observational of hunters.  And then you have the fantastic gameplay systems, and oh man... I feel that this combat is FromSoft at their absolute best. Its fast, frantic, and deadly, leading to many close calls and big sighs of relief after taking down a particularly tough boss or making it through a difficult section. The level design is probably my favorite part of the game. They have a way of building these fantastic levels with varying degrees of elevation that wrap back around in providing shortcuts for the player, taking into account everything about the player experience and using it to mess with the player in very unique ways. I wish so much that other developers would take hints from this, because I feel like this is one of the only games that takes the medium which it is in seriously.  Soulsborne games are known for being hard, but they arent necessarily that difficult. They ask something of the player: they ask the player to put in effort. The more effort you put in, the more carefully you play and the more prepared you make yourself for what lies ahead, the more you will progress. Some easy tips for those who are starting: start coming up with small farming routes as you move through the first areas. Experiment with taking out enemies and then going back to the lamp and coming back and repeating this. Talk to the doll to level up with the blood echoes that youve collected. Whenever you hit a wall, do a little bit of leveling. You will also pick up these items called blood stone shards. These are very important, as they will upgrade your weapons. Each weapon can upgrade up to +10. Leveling up and upgrading your weapon are key components of the Soulsborne franchises, and I see a lot of new players giving up prematurely because they dont take advantage of these things in order to get ahead.  Speaking of grinding, Soulsborne is also not a franchise where time spent training against enemies is wasted. As you go down these paths, you start to become better at fighting the enemies. You memorize how they move and attack and start to make better decisions when fighting them. This element of teaching the player is key. There isnt a such thing as a waste of time in a Soulsborne game. Every death is a lesson learned, and the game is actually fairly forgiving. You arent really repeating content, because when you go through the level again, you now understand more clearly what challenges lie ahead, and that experience is critical to advancing. When you make it to the end, you feel like YOU worked to get yourself there, and it feels incredible. Theres nothing else like it.  So... yeah. This review is a mess and I wish I could go over it again, but I have some things to tend to. Bloodborne is incredible and probably one of the greatest games of all time, and my personal 2nd favorite of all time.;7334;;;;;c;4456;151698

2283;;This game is skillful challenge with moments of hair ripping devastation. You already know that. What is sometimes overlooked about the game is the excellence of the developers commentary as you play and the simple genius of his medium as message theme of coming to terms with even catastrophic setback.

2284;;Constantly fresh, charming, clever, and touching, this is interactive fiction as good as Ive seen. Its not a walking simulator anymore than Bioshock is. Its not more of a movie than a game. This is a game mechanically constructed to tell the story it houses. Uncovering the curious tales behind the deaths of the Finch family in all of their bittersweet magicality is like taking an introspective stroll through a quiet corner of Disney World while pondering the last time that you and your ex lover were happy together.

2285;Overall I give this game a 7/10. The game doesnt really do anything wrong, but it doesnt take any risks either. Youll probably enjoy it if you like a decent, fast-paced WO2 shooter. Otherwise, you wont be missing anything special.;The single player is very mediocre. The only thing that stood out was the sound quality. There was one moment were you and your team had to capture a hill and suddenly got ambushed. Bombs started dropping everywhere, people are dying all around you, panic, chaos... I could really feel the impact. This was probably the only time where I felt anything.  The characters did nothing for me. The back story for the main character was very forced and didnt contribute anything. The Josh Duhamel character was probably most enjoyable. The gameplay was poor, especially when you realize that enemies keep re-spawning until you move forward. This is a gameplay-mechanic that Ive hated forever. You just move forward and everybody dies - Immersion: 0/10. After about six hours youve completed the game and will probably never go back to it.  (5/10)  The multiplayer has its good moments. It really depends on the map. USS Texas is just a standard 3 lane map without any flanking possibilities. None of the maps do anything special. Loot boxes are not really trusted upon you, which is a good thing since the EA-fiasco. Everything about this game screams meh. I know meh is not a solid review word. But when you are one of the biggest companies in the world making a mediocre game then I think it says enough.  One positive is the new class-system. Unlike previous games there are now 5 classes you can choose from (close combat shotgunner - standard rifleman - heavy infantry with lmg - sniper - fast paced smg). The classes are well balanced and provide some tactical advantage on certain maps. Mastering different guns is advised which is a thing of beauty.  (6.5/10)  Zombies is... well its zombies... If you like zombies youll probably like this version as well. They have made it a lot easier to get to higher rounds, but have made it really difficult after round twenty. The easter eggs are very complicated but enjoyable with friends. The map is actually very good and I cant wait for the DLC on this one.  (8/10);28204;This is one of the biggest video games series in the industry. There are a lot of people that dislike COD, and I am one of them. Dont get me wrong, I play these games a lot. Why?

2288;;So far, the VR Experience (Short Game), I enjoyed the Most.  The setting was just extremely impressive and the feeling flying aside a huge cruiser is fascinating in company, with a good (surround) sound (system). They showed many possibilitys for a Star Wars VR game and the normal HUD was worked nicely into the cockpit.  The reason I only give eight out of ten points, is, that the steering is slightly counter intuitive and you need the full game for the quite short experience.;26404;;;;;c;29191;154820
2289;;It may be a short one, but the story is interesting enough to make you want to play the rest of the games. Who wouldnt like to help the dead pass away, anyway? I just wish I liked Rosa a bit more. Shes always so annoying. And Joey is a sexist pig.;9043;;;;;c;4225;154914

2297;;One of the best Games I ever played.  Deep story, with catching characterdevelopment from different views. Giving the player just enough understanding at a point to keep a high tension throughout the whole game. The soundtrack delivers a great atmosphere. (Keeping it short, to spoil nothig)  The only downside for me, is, that the difficulty settings are kinda strange. In the beginning the Game has a good difficulty on Normal setting. But allways instakilling you on Hard, making Very Hard obsolete. Later in the Game, you are by far too powerful at Normal settings, changing to Hard now, youll still have a slightly, too high damage output. Versing normal enemies, the damage, you take, is just right, again. But versing any more complicated enemy, it still ends up in an instakill.;11208;;;;;c;29191;156622
2298;;Just a complete, all around joy to play. Maybe it panders just a little bit to longtime Mario fans in order to hit that nostalgia sweet spot, but it feels so rewarding when it connects on that level.

2349;;Awesome Game <3 <3 <3 <3 Loved from the start to the end woah;28540;;;;;c;29796;157980
2351;;While the gameplay itself is nothing exceptional, the overall experience and presentation is unlike anything Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Plus it grabbed my curiosity in wanting to learn more about Norse mythology, Celtic culture, and mental illness. Nothing like a video game to make you want to enrich your life beyond it.;7603;;;;;c;29411;157989
2352;I could go on for a while with this review. But Im just going to tell you to pick this game up if you havent already and see for yourself. This game deserves a 10/10. If only I could get that Johnny Guitar song out of my head!;It actually wasnt until I saw a youtuber called Many A True Nerd do a kill everything and kill no-one run that I understood how great of an RPG New Vegas actually is. While Fallout 3 always leaned on the shooter genre, New Vegas brought back the role playing aspect and freedom youd come to expect from a game like this. And yes, maybe this game isnt as accessible as Fallout 3 or Fallout 4, but it does things in its own way.  The story is amazing, the characters are rich, the environment is unique while still being believable, The factions are pieces of a perfect puzzle so masterfully put together. Everything about this games makes sense. And everything about this game screams perfection, but you have to be willing to listen.;16;I have to be honest, I didnt like this game when it first came out. I was very confused with the story, the atmosphere was very different from what I expected. But then again Id always had problems with loving RPG immediately . So just like Fallout 3, Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher 3 etc., I put the game down for a while and came back tabula rasa. I love all those games now , but this one Is the best.;;9;;Perfection, but not at first glance.;28831;152801
2353;;Not worth it, so old simple style, and there is no progress saving, player to make it in one GO, as well as very repetitive graphic and atmospheres.;81532;;;;;c;14350;157971
2354;;Absolutely amazing game! A game that changed my perspective on video games completely. It will forever hold a place in my heart. I would (and still do) recommend the game to anyone!;6036;;;;;c;29824;158078
2355;;For an indie game made by a team of 4, this game is absolutely amazing! I bought it less than two months and I have already put in 55 hours in it, there is something really addictive to trying out different sets of mechs/tanks/agravs and guns and go on a rampage. The games graphics are quite good and their 90s vibe makes for a different aesthetic, and the sound makes every shot feel distinctive and powerful. The soundtrack is great and again adds to the whole 90s feeling. The gameplay is harder than a conventional FPS, but it is deeply rewarding when you understand it, as it enables more complex tactics. The game in itself is hard, but it forces you to think rather than go all guns blazing, and when you finish an operation, there is again a deeper sense of reward than other conventional shooters. Although the story of the game is not its principal attraction, the lore of the gameworld makes for a very interesting sci-fi universe. Best weapon: Harvester siege cannon;13361;;;;;c;4013;154946
2356;;It was an awesome game, definitely felt like a good closure to the series to me. I personally think Silent Hill 2 is the best, but this was a really solid game. And i think Heather was a really nice change (and super cool to see her all grown up from the 1st game) And the combat system was great on the account that it still felt like the original 2 games but smoother, and some bigger guns. The story was good, but unfortunately not as chock-full of symbolism as the 2nd game was (though there is still some), losing a lot of that impact its predecessor had on me personally. In my opinion, Silent Hill 3 is the last good one of the series (Silent hill 4 shoulda been its own thing as room 404) And is totally worth the play.;482;;;;;c;29483;158116
2357;;i dont know but seems like a good game but also a lot creepier game too;54678;;;;;c;29843;158177

2364;;Visual Novel game abt story of ancient Chinese setting, with multiple endings to explore, but in this novel game rises with some little more improvements on dialogue options and better immersed player rational reasoning.  Not to forget also +Pos  well drawn scenes and lovely characters beside relaxing Chinese traditional music.;46461;;;;;c;14350;158619
2365;;Set of Gifs showing anime girls with enormous dialogues running, no any player interactions, or routes / endings to choose from, instead of playing the game you can search google for Hot Anime pictures and will have better experience rather than going thru this long story novel game.;55803;;;;;c;14350;141890
2366;;Playing this for the first time , I found final fantasy to be more than a chore.  The game is a real grind. Hours of grinding with the best equipment can still end up incredibly difficult due to the magic system, which limits magic useage to resting, leaving you to instinctively hold all magic for the end of dungeon boss. In order to make it through the game, you end up buying 99 potions at every shop. and healing 30 hp at a time (as there is only one type of potion). In the end maybe my experience was spoilt by the selection of the thief as my second melee attacker, and him ending up as a useless party member, looking online it seemed like most people opted for 2 warriors, which just nails in the fact that maybe jobs could have had a bit more work to them, as due to my selection 3/4 of my party (thief, b mage & w mage) were pretty much useless for the majority of the game  Only recommended for the biggest of fan of the FF series, and even then, be aware that this will not be a fun experience.;385;;;;;c;8607;158622
2367;;One of the best educational puzzle exploration games, ever-played.;83196;;;;;c;14350;158866

2369;;The best that the franchise has ever looked. Amazing to see this Kickstarter-backed success story turn out great results. Not overly difficult, but thats what the hardcore mode is for if youre looking for a challenge. The cast still has the humor and charm of past games while the presentation is smoothly animated.  Although, there is a lot of backtracking to a limited set of levels and many of the missions in the overall story seem to be more like loosely stitched-together side stories in a patchwork quilt. With this in mind, Shantae and the Pirates Curse felt like a better package, but thats not to say I didnt enjoy Half Genie Hero.;11078;;;;;c;29411;159050
2370;;Beautiful world to navigate in a French-inspired setting with a wholesome charm that sometimes felt like I was in a Studio Ghibli movie. There were a lot of mysteries in the story I didnt feel were addressed by the end of the game, but I guess thats saved for the sequel.   Combat was a little clunky and I wish there were more ways of attacking while in mid-air since the principal way of attacking seemed to be launching yourself into a dive kick that overshoots or misses the enemy quite a bit. Thankfully, the game wasnt too long and my time in it felt satisfying enough to not overextend the frustrations I had with it.;12529;;;;;c;29411;159051

2376;;Paperama takes the craft of origami and makes a game out of it. In each round, the clever puzzler provides you with a square piece of paper and challenges you to fold it to create the outlined shape. Paperama starts off easy with outlines such as a simple triangle, and escalates quickly to more complex shapes,  Paperama is a wonderfully satisfying game to play, especially for those who enjoy spatial-style challenges. The game is mentally stimulating -- requiring you to think about your folds before you touch the paper. It also challenges your motor control as you must precisely move the paper to match the fold lines. The only critique is that the folds are sometimes difficult to complete because your finger blocks your view. In these cases, you have to undo a fold and move your phone so you can get a better viewing angle.;83225;;;;;c;14350;159134

2378;;I waited for so long for this game and to be honest, it was a bit of a letdown. As most people said and I agree, it should have been a multiplayer game, I had a bit of fun with it but it was unpolished, a bit repetitive and slightly boring, what they thought they were doing releasing this with so many bugs I dont know. Sad really as I enjoyed the saints row games for what they werr and I know this is not a sequal but I know this team can do better so this game is justa shame really.;19440;;;;;c;23438;159288
2379;All in all, it will probably be a superb game when its finished. For the time being, supporting its development is more than worth it.   Live and drink, friend.;Emerging from a salt desert of roguelikes, Qud differentiates itself by having rich world building, a science fiction theme and a lively and engaged development team. Although still in development, it can already provide more than most finished games can. (Jan 18)  Look - Coming in a classic ASCII or stylish graphic tiles, the colors used are tightly connected to the game world and feel right at place. With the ease with which new tiles can be modded in, you can easily make it yours.  Sound - Although most of the game has no sounds to speak of, the soundtrack is unique and adds to the atmosphere immensely.   Gameplay - It is a roguelike with all that it entails, but with a very easy and accessible UI, an optional permadeath feature and great replayability.  Story - A deep and engaging world influenced by Dune among others, with procedural lore creation which ties into the gameplay,  Qud almost has it all, except its main storyline is not finished yet in the current state of the game. (Jan 18)  Note - The game has an outlandish feeling where everything feels possible, often comical, but never tragic, except of course the myriad of ways your character can die.;24054;Rather like reading a book, Qud happens in your mind rather then on the screen.;;6;;A personal journey through a strange world.;886;159289
2380;;Interesting alteration of Monopoly type games to have more contents and differ ideas, elements, characters, rules,...  Really worth to be tried.;57551;;;;;c;14350;159578
2381;;I bought this game expecting a decently fun shoot em up/run n gun game.  I was pleasantly surprised that it surpassed my expectations.  The artstyle was what drew my interest, but the game also has a fun story with some cheesy humor thrown in.  The gameplay is somewhat varied, as you will gain a few attachments to your gun that require you to mix up tactics at certain points.  Difficulty is moderate, although I did die and restart many times.  It is a decent length, although you get you pay for from this perspective (maybe 5-10 hours?  unless youre really good and breeze through it).  While I havent replayed much in the months since completing it, there is room for that as the gameplay itself is fun and there are some things hidden in the level.  Id give the game 9/10, keeping in mind that it is a reasonably priced indie game.;6732;;;;;c;29825;159579
2382;;88 Heroes is a fantastic game.  Everything about it works for me: the 16-bit style, the music, the character designs, setting, and especially the gameplay.  The game has that old-school difficulty where it can seem downright impossible to get through 88 stages in 88 minutes, but after a few weeks of grinding away, learning the stages, and finding tricks/shortcuts, I can now breeze through the levels and the time limit is a nonfactor.    The characters are quirky, complete with their own mini-backstories, playstyles, etc.  Of the 88, only a small handful are completely useless (Ian Error, maybe El Delayo, Doc Micro, etc.), while the rest have their uses.  Or if youd prefer, choose your own 8-man dream team and play with your favorites.    I have almost no complaints about this game.  Since I played on Xbox One, I will say that I have a minor issue with the controls, mostly when using the joystick.  Everything works great for the most part, but occassionally I would try to move Left/Right and the joystick would register me as moving Down and not move for a second (which can be hazardous in this game!).  I assume its just me not moving the joystick directly along the X-axis, and when using the D-Pad it is much better.  Very occasionally the D-Pad will feel slightly unresponsive, but likely the issue is my controllers.  I have to stress that this is a very minor issue.   10/10.;23501;;;;;c;29826;159581

2386;;Hack n slash with sexed-up heroine and dull design., There is a lot of action, a lot of monster slaying and a lot of Ayumi. Even though she is overpowered it is still challenging to defeat some parts of the game and some bosses. The music fits perfect with the action. The combat is fluid and there are various ways to lay waste on the monsters.;7256;;;;;c;14350;104270
2387;;Zorro is one of the most charismatic popular heroes to have ever existed and whose daring exploits have fed the minds of generations since his creation in 1919. For the first time, a video game brings this mythical dispenser of justice to life. Duels, plots and seduction pave the way for grand adventure!  But it falls in all other aspects.;27627;;;;;c;14350;
2388;;This game is a good take on the Digital Card Game genre, it combines the mechanics depth of Magic the Gathering with simplicity and beauty of Hearthstone. The f2p model here isnt obnoxious, you can totally play this as a free game, but ofc if you want a full collection at all times you can hurry it up with some packs. There are several gamemodes including some singleplayer ones (vs AI) for the times you are just not feeling the urge to play vs players. This game utilizes the fact that it is a digital game well, doing a lot of interesting stuff with its mechanics, also in contrast to Hearthstone it doesnt rely TOO much on RNG (except for the power part, but thats something every deck has to deal with and is kind of a feature). Anyway, if you are interested in Digital CCG - this is the one to try. Its free, what could go wrong?  This game also has a working iOS client (for now its Canada/Australia only, but thats not very hard to get around  D)  While this game is currently in beta/early access it has been feeling as a feature complete and full game for quite some time now, so dont let that scare you away. ================================================================================= Update after 1.26 patch. So, I no longer play this game and cant recommend it, because gold gains have been nerfed intensely twice in a row by the developer, and this game is becoming more and more obnoxiously pay or dont play at least for draft mode.;31198;;;;;c;27313;160267
2389;;I am not really into visual novel type of games (or at least, I think Im not), this is the second game of this genre Ive played so far (first being Va-11 Hall-A) and I am either really lucky with the quality of VN I choose to play or I might actually be a secret fan of this genre.  This looks like a classic anime-style visual novel. Pretty pathetic male main protagonist, put into a strange situation trying (or not trying) to impress/befriend a variety of staple anime-girl-archetypes. Doesnt sound very interesting if you put it that way. But theres more to this game than that.  Its set in an old soviet youth camp, with locations, activities and feel recreated and handcrafted with love. Its an incredibly immersive experience of wandering around, partaking in camp life (or trying to avoid partaking in it), all the while looking at gorgeous backgrounds, and listening to what I can only describe as one of the best soundtracks Ive heard in a long while. The writing is not particularly impressive, but its good enough, which is lucky, considering that most of what you do in this game is read (as per usual for the visual novels). The story was compelling enough for me to try and get multiple endings to just find out, what its all about and experience more of the camp life. While for some this game might inspire sad feelings of wasted youth, misplaced nostalgy or love long lost, for me it was more about the fun atmosphere of childhood, ability to change and finding brightness even in the worst of circumstances.  The steam-version of this game does not include any hentai scenes. If you are really into that, you might want to find an official patch on this games website, it adds around 10 scenes which otherwise will be censored by a black screen. I dont really suggest doing that though, unless you really need that. I dont think it adds much to this game and actually can detract from the immersion and feel for some.  Some endings in this game are pretty hard to find/unlock. If you get stuck you might want to find a map of routes for this game on the web.  All in all. A solid experience, which I would recommend to pretty much anyone, unless you are really opposed to anime-style graphics. Also the game is free, so really there is no downside to at least trying if you might like it =)  PS. I dont think I gave music enough justice, so I need to mention it once more: my personal top5 soundtracks of all time!;8968;;;;;c;27313;160268
2390;;This is a review of the state of the game after the persistence launch (summer 2016) ====================================================================== House deeds cant be bought with ingame gold. Only for real money. Zones are mostly empty. Travel on world map is actually the worst Ive ever seen anywhere. It serves zero purpose, wastes so much time and is gimmicky as hell. This is not an open-world MMO. Everything is instanced. You can basically play in your own private instance the whole time and never join the MMO part. If you choose to play with other people though be ready for not enough monsters/gatherspots for anyone, because maps are empty and seem to be balanced around solo play. There is zero motivation for PVP and most players will never EVER have to participate in it if they dont want. Combat system is so astonishingly mediocre, its almost the same as in UO (I mean, I understand spiritual successor but 20 years have passed. Come on) Out of 10 towns Ive visited: half didnt even have any inhabittants. 3 more had basic nameless vendors and only two were decently populated. There is no quest line to even moderately point you somewhere. All the quests are random get 5 of these, kill 5 of those and even these quests are extremely hard to come by. Ive encountered less than 10 quests in 20ish hours of non-afk play. When farming monsters you get encumbered after 10(!) minutes of farming and looting. Then you have to get back all the way to some shops to sell stuff and vendors might not even be around because they like to sleep or just randomly be somewhere else.  The stuff that is not that bad: Gathering is decent. Crafting seems ok when it works. Skill system is ok. Though I am seriously not a fan of pooled experience and decaying, but I mean its workable. The overall vibe and look of it is good.;3187;;;;;c;27313;160270
2391;;A beautiful gem of an exploration experience for around an hour of time (make sure to at least run this game twice for full experience). Completely free. The pencils are evil.;14872;;;;;c;27313;160271
2392;;A 10hour platformer which is not groundbreaking in any aspect, but still is pretty enjoyable, especially if you like easy games to relax with your gamepad. You follow around a dude with the classic case of amnesia, with a classic funny gimicky companion while doing classic jump and attack stuff. The story is decent, while it is kind of childish (it does seem like a game is geared toward the younger audience, there is not much text in game, the quests are straightforward, even the hidden/secret puzzles are extremely basic, and most of the time are just solved by getting further in the story and getting that upgrade to your jump that you were missing) The fighting system is responsive and fun, though it is pretty basic by most standards, there are basically 3 types of attack + 3 projectile attacks and 2 combos. Thats it. The timings are forgiving, the opponents are mostly tank-n-spank with some variations. There is leveling and equipment system in place, which is robust enough for a platformer game, still in itself it is again very simple at its core (items do not posess much unique qualities, if the armour costs more and was found later in the game it gives more defence and is straight up better, same for the rest of the items.) There are crafting materials and crafting, though to craft highest end stuff in the end of the game - you actually have to grind materials (which I wouldnt expect to find in a platformer and was never inclined to do so) The art in the game is awesome, characters are monsters have decent design effort put into them, though most of the time the designs were reused throughout the game, which is not that great for such a short game anyway.  All in all I dont think I personally would recommend this game over, say, Guacamelee. But it is still quite ok if you liked what you have read.  PS. ♥♥♥♥ unskippable credits at the end of the game so hard.;2130;;;;;c;27313;160272
2393;;God, this game is good. When I backed this at kickstarter I was doubtful if they can deliver on a promise of an old-school-ish RPG in a setting everybody loves (if you didnt play Wasteland, you mustve played at least some of the Fallouts!) in this age. And yet they delivered fully.  This game to my taste played exactly like fallout 1 or 2 with maybe a little more fighting focus then Id want, but thats ok. The setting, while being so familiar at the same time is all-new. The factions are ridiculous but actually make a lot of sense =) Mad monks worshipping a nuclear warhead? Religious people worshipping some ridiculous over_the_top_insane person based on some videocassete? A society of MANNERED people? :D I mean this all sounds bogus but it actually works very well for the story-telling purposes. The atmosphere is amazing. RPG-systems again, while seeming pretty close to what we expect to see in a fallout game are not quite the same. They are neat, understandable and functional though. No problems with them. This game has incredible amount of well-written dialogue and text. Its immense really. Very fair share of my 70-80 hours of walkthrough were spent reading. And I love it =) Overall course of story is enjoyable and while its nothing new (youre rangers, you save the world, duh) it still has some interesting twists and bits to it that were pretty good. The gameplay holds up, the variety of ways to accomplish things are there and you can totally skip like 30-40 hours of content if you wish to do so (I didnt and my walkthrough was as close to full as I could possibly imagine, though I still guess I missed some things). The music and sound design are very fitting to the atmosphere and are impeccable. I have some problems with some particular systems like weapon-salvaging or the randomness of loot in chests, or too many chests too loot (which can become tiresome for a loot-hoarder like myself), but those are most likely just my own problems really, more than the problem with the game =)  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, thank Inxile for not failing me and waiting for Wasteland3 (Yes, Ive seen the IBM AT and I shiver with anticipation! :D)  Also the title song is incredible.;3101;;;;;c;27313;160273
2394;;Pretty interesting little game, definitely worth a try at the price asked for it (and if you manage to catch it on sale its practically free, really). This zombie-shooting sidescroller plays like a roguelike: you can finish it in 1 hour, but really its the different approaches and different tries that seems to be the point of the gameplay =) I liked the 8bit graphics, fast pace of gameplay, ease of picking the game up and understanding what is going on perfectly. I had fun killing a couple of hours with it, but I doubt that Ill be playing it much in days to come.;5448;;;;;c;27313;160274
2395;;Excellent shooter. Highly recommend  Set in a somewhat postapocalyptic soviet environment this is a classic First person shooter with some super-powers added besides the usual guns. Gameplay is reminiscent of Bioshock, while the setting and atmosphere are close to Metro 2033. You play as an american soldier sent to investigate closed down and abandoned Soviet facility, where you uncover mistery E99 element and events follow. What I really liked about the game: -The gameplay is very solid. You have good amount of different, well-designed weapons (the game keeps giving you new ones right until the end, that way it keeps things interesting). Also you have some superpowers (not from beginning but quite early into the game you get your first one) and the list of the things you can do grows. Timeshift bubble, aging opponents, impulsing all around you, telekinesis. All that good stuff. Overall, the shooting part is fun and makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ The puzzles wont take  -The setting. Very gruesome, graphic. Reminiscent of Metro but more paranormal stuff. What is not particularly great but holds up: -The story. Its pretty linear and straightforward for a game about time-travel and altering history/future, but still it is enjoyable and grips you until the end. The game even has 3 endings, but they are basically the same, just different cut-scenes in the end and you can replay last 1 minute of the game to see them all. What I disliked: -For a game thats been out for like 2 years already theres too many bugs. Ive had to restart the game around 5 times due to game-breaking bugs (NPCs stuck or disappearing, doors not opening e.t.c) and the thing is - Ive wasted good amount of time in each of those instances to figure out that something is wrong. Once there was a sequence where a girl opened some door and I needed to defend her from monsters. Well, the thing got stuck and the monsters spawned endlessly and I couldnt undestand that something is wrong until I wasted all my bullets, medkits, e99 energy and they just killed me (I wasted around 10-15 minutes I think) and after restart the process ended in like 3 monsters and 15 seconds.  All in all, solid title. Recommend to play it if you like shooters, enjoyed Metro 2033 and/or Bioshock.;571;;;;;c;27313;160275
2396;;Finally had the time to finish the game so heres a review.  The game had incredible potential but failed miserably in too many important aspects to be good. What I liked about the game: -Setting. Its awesome, ctOS is incredible, deadsec, rogue hackers, usual gangsters and all_controlling_corporations, all that blends great in this particular title. The city looks great and is pretty dope to just run around in. -Variety of systems. The mechanisms for this game to be variative and interesting is there. Bunch of different minigames, hacking, contracts, whatever. They could do great things with it. What is OK in this game: -Characters and story. Nothing groundbreaking but it was ok. Some characters are interesting, some are cliche, overall I finished it for the story and wasnt THAT disappointed. -Combat system. Usual shoter stuff. Different enemy types, different weapons (though weapon system is really badly designed, as most of the game is  D), cover, shoot stuff in head. Would be borderline boring but add hacking and it becomes quite fun. What is really wrong: -Its a console game. The controls are weird. The smart I_help_you_aim system might be cool for controllers, but its obnoxious for a keyboard. I am not a fucking moron I know which minimap icon I want to pick (and the system wont let me, trying to correct me to another closest one). You obviously cant look upward in the sky in most situations (and helicopter which you want to hack is always there), because humans cant do that. Car/weapon/phone interfaces are very bad (which is usual for a game adapted for gamepads). -Gameplay is repetitive and offers NO sense of achievement. I didnt care about getting skillpoints or leveling around 3 hours into the game. The skillsystem is forced and uninteresting. Ive spent all my like 50 skillpoints near the end of the game just for lulz. The contracts are so similar its not interesting doing then, its also not a challenge at all. And there is no point in doing them, because there is barely any reward. Money is not needed in the game ever. There is no point in buying anything except top weapons (and you can do it pretty easily in the first 3-4 hours), then your weapon progression is freezed. There are many systems implemented, but none got really polished and designed to the end. -Uplay. Forced uplay, no steam achievements and interactions. Screw that shit (also failed to synchronize save games with cloud after 50% of game sessions. Are you serious?) -Locked in local language. They locked me into playing in russian language which is not cool. Noone does that, but for this game they decided to do. I dont like it. -Game is still bugged in performance and freeze aspects, but there are DLC already. As usual with these types of releases though. Theyre here to make money, not a good game.  Considering I preordered this one I am severely disappointed. Do not buy and dont preorder the 2nd one (which will come for sure). Lets see if they learn from mistakes.;1121;;;6;;My thoughts on Watch Dogs;27313;160276
2397;;A game from creators of Bastion. Oh, what expectations Ive had for this one. Obviously had the preorder with the soundtrack going and played it day one. And what a strange experience it was. I like most aspects of the game, and yet I wasnt inclined to play it at all next time, so I finished it only now (2-3 months later?) by forcing myself to do it which is pretty sad, because the main story is actually VERY short. Without much of side challenges (which are decently designed but most of the time force you to play with predesigned powers (functions) installed and it was pretty unfun for me, because I like to design my own tactic in this game) the game takes around 3 hours to finish. With getting some challenges done it goes up to 4-5 hours. Nevertheless, I dont think this gamelength is really acceptable, so thats a sure con for me. Now some pros and some more cons.  Pros: -The music. Its very good, wouldnt expect otherwise from Darren Korb. While the game was sitting idle in my library, the soundtrack I have purchased got its share of plays in the last months. Just like in the Bastion. One thing I would say it feels a bit lacking of electronic elements, which would be suitable in this setting.  -The art is impeccable, with great love to detail. Just like in Bastion. -The setting. Very strange, interesting, kind of unique. Just like in the Bastion. -The functions-system. Robust and full of variations, makes for good replayability and interesting levelups. For some cons: -The story. Very basic, not trying to hook you in at all. Mostly it goes by like whatever, I am here somewhere, go on now. Theres not much happening at all, the synopsis of the story would take approximatly 1 page after its all done. I mean, I dont belong to the type of players, who cnat play a game, which is weak on story, but I require at least good gameplay to have interest in it. -The game-play. Repetitive, gimmicky and boring overall. The planning thing is gimmicky, overpowered and breaks the flow. The regular mode makes you feel seriously underpowered and is a bit of a cluster-fuck. After Ive found the right functions combination, all of the fights where just a grind. In combination with the first flaw - it is why it felt like I dont want to go on (I just couldnt figure it out in the first hour yet). -The sword. He is so whiny and emo it makes me want to smack him and tell him to grow a pair. While he is the 80% of the means how the story and setting is conveyed to player, in the end I just wished he would shut up -_-  Overall, you might want to check it out at your own risk, but this is no Bastion.;3022;;;;;c;27313;160277
2398;;Great story in a very unusual setting. If you have enjoyed Telltales previous adventure experiences you will most likely love this one too. The gameplay is pretty basic (well, duh), you select dialogue titles and sometimes do QTE, which seem to be impossible to fail. It is most certainly not the strong part of the game, but it will do. The strong part is the story, set in rich setting of Fabletown, the town where all the Fables (characters from stories, myths and so on) live in modern times. You play as a hard-ass Big Bad Wolf (or sheriff Bigby Wolf, whatever you like) going through the story to unravel a series of mysterious events. The dialogues are great, characters are interesting, the ending is pretty spectacular. Actually the ending is so good, that the community still cant decide what happened :D   Anyway, if you can handle a game being not much of a game, but more like a TV series with some interaction, this surely is a must play.;2993;;;;;c;27313;160278
2399;;Great 10 hour-experience for those who loved Far Cry 3 and want that itch scratched a year later. The setting helps too, very refreshing and entertaining. Overall enjoyed this one very much and surely recommend!;2001;;;;;c;27313;160279
2400;;Just finished part 3 of this trilogy (Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia) and decided to write a review for the whole series. Of course its only right to place it here, where the story starts.  At heart this is a classic point and click adventure. A genre claimed to be dead, but getting ressurected from now and then by talanted indi-storytellers. This time its Daedalic, a company of which Ive never heard before (though they do seem to have several pretty critically acclaimed games out at this point, so it might be just my ignorance) with their take on humour, creativity and random fun. =) This game reminds me of the Runaway series, witty and charming main protagonist goes through unlikely events during a trilogy growing up and becoming a bit better.  Actually, just play this game if you miss the point&click fun, you wont regret.  PS. The ending somewhat... left me hanging. >_<;5060;;;;;c;27313;160280
2401;;He has travelled the planet And made all these new friends Including the sweetest girl they call Goal. But most dreadful of events Unfold, and the challenges await The hero, will he be up to test? No doubt the third part is the best. Huzzah, the third ones the best!;5064;;;;;c;27313;160281
2402;;First of all: fuck uplay. I seriously hate this god awful bullshit excuse of a software as much I hate origin. And that says much. I guess cloud synchronizing save-game files is just too much of a feature to ask these days, huh? Just delete this disgrace and do it properly in Steam along with everything else instead of trying to push your useless subpar piece of software.  Now, to the game: Its incredible. I love it to pieces, 24 hours in I am nowhere near final stages of the game it seems. If you liked Classic M&M - you will like this most likely. It does stray from some of the canons of 6-8, sometimes back to the roots, sometimes just keeping in tune with current-gen design practices. But the main - the feel of M&M is there, and its gorgeous. I wouldnt try to compare it to Legend of Grimrock (though the comparisons really jumps to mind), because essentially the things that are great about this game are non-existent in LoG (Lore, colorful world, variety of characters, skills and systems) and vise a versa the things that made LoG great are a bit on the sidelines here (secrets are a plainer system, puzzles are not that convoluted, combat system not dynamic at all (its actually Turn-based here), I would even say the graphics were a bit more spot on in LoG.  Nevertheless, If you have waited for this game: buy it now, you will not regret it. If you havent waited for this game: check out the videos to see if its something that you might enjoy and probably give MM 6/8 a whirl first before picking this up, because thats an immortal cllassic. I cannot fully say this one is too, because I do see some problems with it.;5641;;;;;c;27313;160282
2403;;If you are thinking about necro-gaming on this particular title: dont do it. The game doesnt hold up and has nothing of note that can compete with current gen A-RPGs. Battle-system is plain, simple, slow and not smooth at all. Item system seems decent, but very boring also, and dont even get me started on skills and stats. This mightve been ok ~10 years ago (but I was bored by it even then, when I first tried this game), its definitely not ok now.;8311;;;;;c;27313;160283
2404;;Classic game, the fifth iteration is by far the best! After a bit shaky 4, the fifth take on the immortal classic by Sid Meier hits the sweet spot. Not only is it gorgeous, smooth, and well-designed graphically, but it offers a great variety of features and complexity which does not feel forced.  Recommend to play with both addons available to date. Gods and kings was not particularly good when it came out, felt a bit early and not ready. The second addon though fixed all of the problems, while expanding those that felt a bit lacking.  If you got that turn-based-itch, look no further than this game =);866;;;;;c;27313;160284
2405;;This is incredible surprise. I expected nothing of the game, because Ive never played the previous part and have never read any books from this setting, and I came out of it knowing that I now need to play the first part and probably read some books after.  This game is something that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. needed to be but failed at. Full of atmosphere, story-driven with impeccable gameplay. The setting of post-apocalyptic Russia is pitch-perfect, the surroundings are immersive, they show a grim picture of the world gone wrong.  The game is hands down best FPS 2013. Probably GOTY 2013 even. PS. The good ending is kinda hard to get =) Though realistically - I liked my ending also, because its not really a you failed one. Its just different.;539;;;;;c;27313;160285
2406;;Great design, awesome 8bit retro style graphics, fast-paced kinda hardcore roguelike with robust item-system. Incredibly fun. PS. Also very playable on gamepad.;3029;;;;;c;27313;160287
2407;;Its one of those Id rather not call it a game, but an art project type of releases that weve got so many this year. Its a point and click adventure in style with barely any gameplay, you follow along a person and his dog on a strange journey that asks many questions and doesnt like to give answers. Minimalistic strange graphic design will most likely not get in your way, but is not really great to look at if you are not a fan of Picasso or smth like that :D Most of the time spent in this game is reading dialogue and descriptions of items. Probably going to be even more convoluted in later chapters, but I do not care to find out.  PS. I dont think this is even out fully yet, they seem to be releasing chapters once in a while and Im not sure how many of them will be there really, but unless you are really intrigued by what youve read - dont bother. =);5614;;;;;c;27313;160293
2408;;I am not sure on this one. Its a decent puzzle/platformer/adventure with a kind of interesting control scheme and some nifty gameplay mechanics. Art and style design is perfect, so is the sound. But remove that and the game is kind of boring. It had its moment, but for the most part I wasnt that much engaged. And for seemingly emotion-oriented game it failed to move me at most important times. Also, very short. 4-5 hours of gameplay time. Also, seems to be designed for gamepad. Played it on one, but didnt like it. I guess I should not recommend this.;1334;;;;;c;27313;160295
2409;;This game is amazing. Start with insane electronic beats that will drive you crazy. Continue with acid 8bit style of neon-packed 80s. Bring convoluted story which makes no sense (or does it?) Dont forget lightning fast skill based gameplay, which will frustrate you just the right amount to get you in the correct mood. Top it off with incredible atmosphere that ties it all together. Then you get Hotline Miami. Most def one of the highlights of 2013 gaming year and a must play.;1384;;;;;c;27313;160296
2410;;Gorgeous game. Impeccable style, fast pace action and grasping story. Also, sound design is awesome. A must play!;1051;;;;;c;27313;160297
2411;;Ok, so after all of it is done I want to change the review quite a bit. I now regret preordering the series and supporting the project and am sure to NOT buy the next installation which is sure to come. As with most things the rule the first part is always the best works 100% for this one.  The first game hooked me up with incredible variation of settings, story and twists. This part doesnt have that. For the most part its actually boring, it falls back on the OMG emotions, but kinda fails to inspire any. Contrary to the first game, it has less interesting choices (or rather doesnt even pretend that your choices even matter). Most of the conflicts in the game are dumb, characters barely likable (except for the main protagonist of course), it seems like the writing for this one was done not out of inspiration, but mainly out of we_need_to_hit_them_deadlines. And well, in a story-based game with barely no gameplay - bad writing is a no-go.  Overall, if we consider the first game 10/10, this one is 7. And I would prefer Ive never played it just because it ruined the good name of Walking Dead (the game) for me.;3097;;;;;c;27313;160298
2412;;This is a hard one to judge. I purchased this on the release day with the sole purpose of playing coop with a friend, but that failed miserably as the net-code of the game was severely broken and it was unplayable @ multiplayer. So, I forgot about this game for half a year and just now realised that I havent played it yet, so I gave it a try. This is a classic hack-n-slash, lets break it down to points a little bit. pros: -Good setting, steampunk, mad scientists, vampires, monsters. All that good stuff. -Gameplay feels solid. UI is good, mechanics are there and do not fall apart. -Katarina =) cons: -Out of 3 classes of heroes - 2 are locked away in DLC. Thats just a dick move really. -Simplicity of its core. Zero build diversity, while you have to appoint attributes and skills - its pretty much useless, you might as well had them auto-allocated. Action is not as good and diverse as in Diablo 3, systems behind the game are not as deep and complex as in Path of Exile.  I will definitely finish the game, because it grabbed me in some way, but I really couldnt recommend to buy this game, as it seems like a easily skippable one.;2638;;;;;c;27313;160299
2413;;Despite suffering from the usual rockstar-pc-port syndrome and being unplayable first half of the year since it hit Steam, these days this is a very-very solid experience unique in many ways. Grasping detective story unfolding in a 1960s (I think :D) America features great gameplay, fast-paced narrative combined with assortment of heroes to follow. It might look like a spin on GTA from afar, but its certainly not. There is driving and shooting in a big city here, true, but at this games core are clues, dialogues and logic. Highly recommend!;109;;;;;c;27313;160300
2414;;This is a strange one. I really loved its bits, but as a whole I found it disinteresting after 2-3 attempts (2 hours of game-time). Just didnt feel it grasping me and didnt feel inclined to try it one more time, while I dont particularly have anything bad to say about this game. You should probably look up some videos, or try it by yourself. But I cant wholeheartedly recommend it.;3075;;;;;c;27313;160301
2415;;Great platforming fun. Best gamepad game of 2013 =) (Seriously, do not bother playing with keyboard on this one. Gamepad is the only good choice here.) Retro 8 bit graphics + neat humour in detail + fast-paced skill-based action-paced button-smash arcade-platformer sweety-goodness. Neat uprage and progress system, hard boss-fights, different types of classes play differently. Easily best 10-15 bucks game out there.  PS. Also has a game+ type of thing if you are into that. Just beating it once was good enough for me though =);3221;;;;;c;27313;160302
2416;;New review after playing Lifeline DLC.  Still holds up as a game. Still a great 15-20 hour experience in a town surrounded by zombies. If polished and expanded on, this game might be genius and godly. At this point its solid, grasping and very playable. And even replayable as DLC proves. Because basically Lifeline is the same gameplay in another town with another premise (now we are the army, not random survivors and we get orders), other than that and new weapons, new car and some new features (car trunk, dayum!) its pretty much the same game. You establish a base, you try to upgrade it and you scavenge for resources, while rescuing people and ultimately trying to escape the city (or do whatever it is you are supposed to do). Very fun for a weekend. Though there are some major flaws to the game including: -its a console game. All the bad stuff that is usually accotiated with it is here. -bugs (sometimes I even had to reload to unbug stuck characters) -not that great overall gamedesign: the base upgrades seem pretty useless and lackluster, the inventory system is not perfect to say the least (yeah, yeah I get it its a console game), different cars dont differ so much, weapons too, really. The fighting system is sloppy. Infestation/incoming horde/hunt the zed mission feel like a useless chore. The reputation system is strange and I am not even sure why its there. The resource system is better but still its not at the core of the game and sometimes I find it hard to even understand why I need a medic, medical station and supplies or food. So, I mean. The flaws are there. Still the experience is very solid and I stand by my old review: ========== Zombies. Sandbox. Survival. Limited ammo, heroes that will quickly get ripped apart if overwhelmed, struggle for resources and other survivors. If all that floats your boat - you have to play this. =) =============  I hope if they ever do a part two, they get more work done in the design field, because the outline of the gameplay is there and its good.;3049;;;;;c;27313;160303

2420;;Having loved Super Mario World 2: Yoshis Island, I figured this would be a no-brainer for me to pick up. The sense of child-like wonder and tactile appearance of something constructed as a kids art project still carries over and looks better than ever in this iteration.  While it looks and sounds like a pleasant stroll in the park, the gameplay however made for a frustrating time. Maybe Yoshi always handled this way and I just havent noticed it until now, but theres something floaty and unwieldy about him now. Some of the levels had clever designs, but the demands for item collecting and finding everything in a stage got pretty tiresome when they hide everything disguised as regular items or dont become visible without feeling the air around first. But, I suppose thats what the badges are for which provide certain temporary abilities that will help with this...for a cost, of course (in-game currency, that is).;7343;;;;;c;29411;160312
2421;;The Psycho Pass anime has a world that is deserving of more exploration. I had hoped this game would delve deeper into that world, and it did in some places, but I felt that it ended up coming short by focusing in on a set of new characters that just werent all that interesting.  At the beginning, you have the choice of playing as a the cold, withdrawn, amnesiac inspector Kugatachi or as a the brash, hot-headed, well-meaning enforcer Tsurugi. I went with the latter as he at least seemed to present more color to this character. Something Ive learned with a lot of fiction is that it is damn near impossible to make amnesiac characters work without being able to take it seriously enough. Perhaps if I played as the inspector I would have learned more about her mysterious past, but she was just so dry that I dont expect it to be an interesting enough playthrough. At this point I dont feel a strong need to go through the game again as the inspector since my playthrough as the enforcer already telegraphed in a very ham-fisted way what the plot twist is supposed to be with these characters (and they didnt even end up revealing it in my playthrough).   The inclusion of the previous characters from the Psycho Pass series is of course a plus, especially when theyre voiced by their original Japanese voice actors. Other than that, the extras to this game dont seem all that significant, and the game does warrant multiple playthroughs to get all endings and details of the plot, its just not convincing enough to do all that, even as a lover of the Psycho Pass series.;23849;;;;;c;29411;160315

2428;;Follow the anguish of a tortured soul in this horror, allegy-based supremacy game, dressed as a cute kawaii guide to go though Japan.  An eyeless, countryless and nameless character is lured out to spend thousands of dollars in plane trips to make a one week trip to japan to meet his online buddies, Makoto and Akira to spend a bro-week reading manga, going to karaoke and probably watching hentai (but not porn, thats gaijin). Instead, to his dismay, he finds out that his efforts to learn Japanese during months or even years were all in vain, since Makoto and Akira were lying to him during months (or even years) about their gender.  Yes, that is right: Makoto is a mature, super nice, super cheerful and SUPER BORING busty girl, whereas Akira is a tsundere, tomboyish, mean, rough flat girl which is also an excellent cooker, tour guide and hinted to be a bit otaku. He will sleep sleep the entire week in their week and eat for free without their parents being in home (they are, of course, doing productive business to raise the mighty japans economy). WHAT A WICKED FATE OUR CHARACTER HAVE ENCOUNTERED.  In Go! Go! Nippon!: My First Trip To Japan youll watch how our eyeless character is sucked from his personality as he is amazed by everything single stupid thing he encounters, and has to hear a tour guide during one week with two poorly animated sprite girls (in 2015 and 2016 version) which has the clear effect to make him think that japan is the cleanest, safest, most advanced country with best technology, best traditions, best food, best fireworks and best overall and any country in earth can compete it. Yes, thats why our main HERO doesnt have a specified country: all countries in earth cant compare to japan.  Not only that, but our hero will be forced to do another surprise trip the next year to meet with his interest that will probably dump him cuz hes not a pure race japanese. And since this game doesnt have DLCs, or sequels, but remakes of the same game with new content, our hero is forced to do this trips THREE times (which makes six flights to japan. I can hear the bill rising even from here folks) just to revive the exact experiences.  The exact same surprises.  The exact same PAIN.  Clearly this is a modern masterpiece under a mask of badly-done japanese publicity.;16675;;- The DLCs put greedy EA to shame.

Director-san: [Nods in Japanese]  Japanese-kun: You see, I have come to see the sucess of Phoenix Wright games, and the Western obsession with police novels and movies, that have permeated in Japan. I think we can take both concepts and put them in a way to advance our mighty japanese videogames and show all the westerns the potential of Visual Novels, so we can sell them easily outside.  Director-san: [NODS INTESIFIES IN JAPANESE]  Japanese-kun: So, I have come to my friend and we thought about the Kara no Shoujo concept game - Girl in a Shell. See the cover? Damn, isnt it NICE? The game would be a crime investigation game. Here we have a draft [gives draft in Japanese] and I think it got really well. Our dozens of hours of job shows! Its set in 1956, so theres no mobile, big technology or something to put you more in the pure detective scenario, twisted crimes that catch your attention and are in tune with modern police novels, also the post-war era sets the tune really well with those two aspects. We have the protagonist which doesnt have voice but had fiancee and is in mid-thirties, making him a cool protagonist as well, as a macho way (all japanese say that sentence once per day, as we all know).  Director-san: Viele interessanto, Japanesu-kun. Aber howdo abouto the kawaii girlo in the cover?  Japanese-kun: Ah yes, thats the best part! You see, to contrast the gritty dark atmosphere, we established a slow paced game so you learn all the different and interesting characters in first hand. We took lot of preparation to make them really likable but differenciated from one another! We put a lot of effort to it to make these characters interesting enough to appeal female audience too, since many like this sorts of dramas but are not used to these games! And since the atmosphere is so western and dark, it is a big shock when you see that the victims are high school girls, hence the white uniforms, and...

The developer of this game understood how to mimic a real snake movement into a game controller binding keys. Thanks to the lack of lives (tries) and unlimited time the game lets you explore the levels as much as you like. Plus, it wont punish you for failing.  As I was saying, gameplay wise, the control of the character (his name is Noodle) is unique and satisfying with a level design that will challenge your skills and adaptation to those unique mechanics.   The level design is good initially and with every world, there is a new element added to it (Lava, rotating poles, wind etc). With that being said, the levels become more and more mundane as they dont add enough to hook me up for long.  If a story is something you were looking for, you will find almost none of it, just a generic adventure with a mute protagonist and its sidekick without any twists nor character development.  Overall is a very likeable 6 hours game in order to beat and probably few more hours in order to collect all the collectables. Hopefully, it will get a sequel which will live up to its full potential;19220;;Could have more complex level design  Worthless Collectibles;;Unique Game Mechanics Nice Presentation Suitable Music;c;9387;161929

2500;;Its a Half Life 2, mod, built by Garry Newman. * The MODP * site is published as a mode. At first, the name changed to twitter with the help of the name and Garrys mod, as done. After the mountain came to the game, the game came to steam, as the update came popular. and proceeded to update with steam. you can do it with all of Half life 2, which you want according to your halay power. at the same time some people in the workshops do Addons, you can add. I guess there is a mode called touble in the terrorize town that Garry has made by a friend of a friend. The basic aim of this mode is trying to kill everybody, there is a treacherous mountain, and others are trying to kill him. one of them trying to kill is a detective, and the other is a game mode where he tries to find the traitor with the obligation to obey him. At the same time, tons of mods are available. but I think I can not tell you these modes so I think it is most logical for you to discover this world yourself.;3278;;;;;c;31234;165258
2501;;I knew going in that this may not be my cup of tea but I ended up disliking it more than anticipated. There is no indication of where to go which isnt necessarily a bad thing, but It becomes a major problem when every room looks the same. I basically walked around until I found elevators to move on. But my actual problem with the game is the controls. The game switch between tight and icy at a moments notice, and throughout my playthrough I had no idea why. Even worse was when the screwattack was brought into the game, because now each jump had three modes it could be in, float screwattack, floaty non-screwattack, and tight screwattack, which became a major problem when trying to do any of the numerous platforming segments or just trying to kill something. Upgrades give little to no indication as to what they are at first glance, leading me to look up online how to use missiles (a mandatory part of the game).  There are three bosses in the game, the first being a sponge, where my only option was to tank all the hits and rely on morphball invincibility, the second being ridley, whom I just stood beside until he died, and mother brain who may be my least favourite boss fight in any game ive ever come across. The lead up to him has you facing off against metroid who steal up to a full energy tank if they touch you.  So by the time you get to the boss youll be lucky to have 200 energy. Then you have to simply spam missiles in a bullet hell fashion. The real problem with this is that some of the bullets are breakable. But because of the bad controls, screwattack fails to proc and cause you to take unnecessary damage, and if you end up in the lava by mother brain itself, you are likely to never get out due to both the bullets and the floatyness pushing you into mother brain.  This may seem like a bit of a rant... and it is. I normally try to point out the positives in my reviews, but there arent many. Some of the music is good, some not so much. Samus being a women was a nice touch for the time but it doesnt really affect the game.   Hopefully Zero Mission fixes these problems as I cant recommend the original in any way, unless you already have nostalgia for the game.;1101;;;;;c;8607;165332

Being able to play in any era throughout history and even into the far future, makes this game quite unique in the historical RTS genre. Everything from playing a deathmatch/skirmish, to going into a historically accurate campaign or scenario felt well polished and always enjoyable.   If there is one game that should get a remake with improved graphics and minor improvements, its this game. (EE2 and EE3 just didnt live up to EE1).

2513;;This game is essentialy very similar to human revolution. The key difference being that it is set post-incident. In the incident the augmented were basically hacked to become feral and attack anyone on sight. This has led to huge divisions in society. There are a lot of clever parallels with how muslims are being treated in the real world.  Its another really fun open world cyberpunk fps. I played through it stealthily and without killing anyone, but its just as fun to play guns blazing.  I really enjoyed that its set in Prague. Somewhere thats been unexplored in video games. The real core of this game is the style. Its in a similar vein to bladerunner and other Phillip K Dick stories.

2515;;A nice short story. The visuals are really cool (lots of crazy effects and nice vistas) and the sound design is great. Its got a bit of a life is strange vibe with a gang of young people and their relationships being the main focus, with a backdrop of supernatural going on. You make choices about how you interact with others and how you progress the story. I felt like I had a lot of control over what kind of person the main character is. You start out with basically no idea whats going on but as you progress the mystery unravels nicely. The devs clearly intended it to be a game you play multiple times but honestly I dont feel that draw. I dont think if I played it again I would get enough new content to justify another 4 hours, just a slightly different ending.;14587;;Not great replay value Weak start but sick with it.;;Good characters and sci fi story.

2517;Good game, but i feel i would have had a smoother experience on a different platform maybe. Still recommended beside few minor flaws :);Having missed L.A Noire when it originally came out, i figured picking it up on the Switch was the perfect timing. I enjoyed the game overall, with a few noteworthy issues however.  The best thing about L.A Noire is its setting. 1940s America is gruesome and dark, yet full of hope. Its not a theme often attempted in many games and i love it for that. It also has some of the best character modelling and voice acting youll see in a game.. still to this day! The interrogation scenes were absolutely the highlights.  However passed the atmosphere, i didnt particularly feel engaged with the main story nor characters. Solves various cases, another day at the office sort of thing.  The Switch version had some notable bugs, i cant really compare with the other versions however. Frequent visible frame drops, audio bugs, tricky controls etc... None of those a deal breaker, but possibly worth pointing out if the other versions are considered.   Also, i didnt particularly feel this was well suited for the Switch. Its definitely not an easy pick up & go type of game, and i played most of it while on plane travels..;59848;;huge frame rate drops clunky controls (especially the shooting) overall story didnt particularly dragged me in;130;fantastic atmosphere and setting Those facial animations!;c;3723;166585

2528;;This game is what youd call...a chore. The game works off the design of FF1 by creating stat specific leveling, this makes the idea of leveling feel a more random, pairing that with the idea of experience capping (the idea of reducing experience from enemies as you become stronger), and the design choice of leveling magic up specifically by use means that every element of the gameplay seems to hinder every other element of gameplay. The game punishes you for grinding specific stats, but also punishes you for trying to level up worse stats because they are less efficient. This either means that every character becomes the same grey blob of skills, or start to become utterly useless during the late game.  The story is serviceable. The world is at war with the empire, who are creating an ultimate warship to destroy cities, the emperor keeps the world at bay with his sizeable army, and his dark knight. The game heavily takes star wars as its inspiration but keeps it unique enough to make it interesting.  The game has some really memorable audio, and there wasnt really any downsides, I particularly liked the Boss Battle themes.   Overall, I cant recommend the game to any but the die hard fans, and even if you do, the grind of this game isnt worth the effort, therefore I recommend the GBA or PSP version which seem to be a lot easier in that sense.;16474;;;;;c;8607;166978

2534;;Splatoon 2 is a different fun multiplayer shooter that has great potential except it feels as though Nintendo forgot the Multiplayer part.  Cooperative play with friends is incredibly restricting and hidden behind multiple hurdles. If you dont have the correct number of friends to play with (either one or three) then you are stuck rolling the dice in mixed-open PvP.   Your friend may be able to join the same room as you, and then may be randomly assigned to your team.  This is a great game surprisingly spoiled by Nintendos failure to remember that people may want to play with people they know from the start instead of being forced to play with sometimes frustrating random players.;26761;;The restrictions on objective-based PvP and lack of ability to set up parties early on kill a lot of momentum behind the game.;;Graphics, music, weapons, gameplay, and story are all a bit off-kilter but in a good way.;c;29451;167606

2539;;I initially believed this game to be some sort of walking-sim taking place in a rendition of purgatory or a coma-triggered dream state which seemed cool enough for a quick playthrough.. the audio and visual pair well to create a great and haunting atmosphere for this relatively entertaining albeit short game (avg playing time 1-2 hrs for the slowest playthrough).  although the graphics are beautifull rendered by Unity, the npc animations tend to slide rather than walk.  however, this does not take away too much from the game as one is usually running from these creatures and during those chase sequences the tension is manifested beautifully.  This games atmosphere is primarily focused upon its magnificent lighting and ambient sound design. The strobe, absolute brightness and darkness utilized through the majority of Starbo are both awesome and nerve-wracking..awesome in that they are used to their fullest advantage and add to the anxiety invoked by the game...nerve-wracking in that sometimes one may think the game is loading only to realize that they are in a dark corner staring at the ceiling and other times it simply can give one a headache (if not a full on seizure: this game is NOT for epileptics).  The voice-acting of the protagonist is well done but not necessarily crucial to the game.  Furthermore, the whole searching for keys (especially with regards to what the setting of the game ends up being) in order to unlock random doors seems to have been added simply to give the player something else to interact (as there is little for the player to interact with oveall) with and are entirely unneccesary.  The auto-save points seem arbitary and are way too spread apart - making a full playthrough in one or two settings highly recommended if not forced. I must admit, though the game is short, its long seemingly cloned corridors can be a bit tedious/boring to tread through when all one wants to do is see the next surreal and beautiful vista. The developers could have added a bit more variation to the aforementioned corridors as the player will be spending about 70-80% of the game traversing them.  That being said, when the game does utilize those corridors in combination with an enemy and soul-piercing audio, it truly is scary...but is it a horror game?   I would say no.  Starbo is a surreal thriller adventure with elements of horror.  Perhaps my favourite mechanic of the game is that in certain points of the game time speeds up or slows down, truly adding to both the terror and the dream-like quality of the game.   Overall, Starbo is a fun playthrough...however, it has absolutely no replayability factor and is much too short to merit any price tag greater than $5.  It was scary and tense when it wanted to be but when i got to the abrupt ending i was rather dissapointed.  Much of the gameplay shown in the trailer is simply not present.  The coolest scenes of the game are fleeting at best. The little exposition there is seems lackluster. What you get is pretty good but upon finishing the game one feels like they just played the first chapter of a much greater work..unfortunately, that is not the case.  If this game had more meat on its bones id be happy to give it a 7 or 8...however, due to its length and wasted potential ill grant it a 6.   please excuse the hurried nature of this review, i was literally writing it during my first playthrough of the game...alt-tabbing every fifteen minutes to add to and take away from my wordiest IGDB review thus far.;80009;;unbelievably short game...wasted potential...NPC animations were lacklustre;;lighting, sound design, and the speed-up/slow-down of time during tense points of the game.;c;4224;168096

2543;A good entry to the Mass Effect IP, and a great game overall. I would recommend that any gamer than enjoys a good story-driven action game ignore the internet rage and play it, and I think the game landscape today could benefit from more games like it (at least the patched, year-after version I played).  The game isnt without its flaws, but the experience is vastly improved in the latest patched versions, and still exceeds your average story-driven gameplaying experience by leaps and bounds.;Ill caveat this review by saying (1) I was already a fan of the Mass Effect series before I played this, (2) I heavily prefer rich, story-driven games generally, and (3) I played this for the first time a year after release (i.e. when a lot of the bugs that plagued the initial release and invoked so much early criticism were patched) after picking it up on sale on Origin for around $12.  Caveat out of the way, I really liked this game and thought it was a good entry to the Mass Effect IP, and a great game overall. I would recommend that any gamer than enjoys a good story-driven action game ignore the internet rage and play it, and I think the game landscape today could benefit from more games like it (at least the patched, year-after version I played).  Mechanics ---------------- Over the course of ~55 hours of gameplay, I only encountered 2-3 instances of egregious facial animation weirdness, and never encountered squadmates/enemies freezing or flickering across the screen.   The combat is superior to all previous Mass Effect games, the explorable environments were gorgeous and larger in scope than previous ME games, the voice-acting of the main cast is great, and driving the Nomad around was perfectly fine (in controlled doses of course, since when is roaming across open, barren landscapes for extended periods of time ever really that fun).  Ive heard criticisms of the crafting/inventory system, and I would say they are warranted, but that since I personally weight such things on the low side, I didnt find that it significantly impeded my enjoyment of the game. Regarding crafting, its more elaborate than it needs to be (3 different types of research points? Weapons need research _and_ development? There are augmentations _and_ mods?) and more of a tutorial would have been appreciated, but I didnt find that I needed to dive deep into crafting to be able to play the combat effectively/enjoyably. Both crafting/inventory suffer from some odd controls (Ive never been so prone to mis-selecting things in a game), but nothing insurmountable. The inventory can also feel like a lot to sift through, and there werent great options for categorizing/filtering.  Characters -------------- I would say the characters are on-par with or slightly lower than ME1 but dont hold a candle to ME2. That being said, I still find that to be a pretty high bar, especially considering how underwhelming character development is in games generally.   I definitely found myself attached, and while I had criticisms of some characters tendencies, I dont think its due to bad writing (at least, not all the time), but rather due to the fact that I personally prefer some behaviors to others. As with ME2, youll get a loyalty mission per character, and I also enjoyed the small just-go-and-chat-with-them missions scattered for each character throughout the story. Wandering the Tempest and hearing ambient conversations, receiving emails, reading the Tempest crew info board, or mixing up pairings on outings and listening to conversations in the Nomad was also interesting and fleshed out the individual characters and their chemistries.  I did find myself annoyed by the way romances were locked-in - theres no confrontational moment as in e.g. ME2 but rather once you lock in a romance, all other romantic interests flirting options just disappear. That I did find annoying and indicative of lazy writing. So, player beware.  Story -------- Its decent. The main storyline will feel derivative, but I still found it enjoyable and (not to sound like a broken record) vastly superior to the majority of games out there. Even the secondary quests (e.g. searching around for the lost arks, activating planets vaults) felt impactful to me, which for me translated to their being enjoyable.  That being said, there will be a number of loose threads by the time you finish. I found myself placated with how the game chose to end (story-wise), though not really satisfied. Being prone to consuming expansive fantasy/sci-fi media myself, Ive become somewhat accustomed to this sort of open ending that leaves room for further development in subsequent installments, so I probably dont share the rest of the Internets rage about it.  I did find the end fight underwhelming (I was shocked when it end since it felt like it was still building up to something greater), and that once that fight ended there was a rush to the credits. Unlike ME3, at least you get post-credit epilogue missions and you can resume play.;7349;;- Clunky inventory and crafting system - Lack of closure on major story threads - Story had a solid premise but failed to make me as invested as in previous games - Mediocre final fight and rush to credits, though at least there are post-credit epilogue missions and you can resume play;6;- ME games continue to set the standard in story, characters, and voice acting - Combat, driving, graphics all improved over previous ME games - Large (for ME) explorable worlds - Minimal bugs if you play the year-after-release patched version;c;25319;168190
2559;;A resource management based game with a great style. The characters are interesting and the writing is good. Its challenging without being punishing and you have a lot of freedom about what kind of police chief you want to be. Get cosy with the mafia or make sacrifices to take them down. Unfortunately the payoff was really lacking. So many times, important plot points were rushed by in a block of text and the ending takes very little account of how you played the game, a bit of a mass effect 3 moment. While I loved the gameplay, it didnt evolve a whole lot throughout the game and was bordering on stale by the end. A few of the detective cases had obscure solutions that required blunt force to solve rather than logic. It is a lot of fun, just missed the mark a few times and seemed to take no notice of all the decisions youve made throughout youre playthrough.;11423;;Parts felt rushed Player decisions had little impact.;;Style, gameplay, writing;c;16595;168498
2560;;Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle...and wonder if well ever get the chance to kill him.   - Was there ever a game that made you question your own place in the world? That made you wonder if it all truly mattered?  - Was there ever a game that made you question whether youre a good person? Whether youre benevolence and kindness is truly genuine and not a result of selfish thought? - Was there ever a game filled with cute-looking nihilistic robots that occasionally use the names of famed philosophers?   I believe that there are games that have tackled these subjects (maybe except for the philosophers names on robots, not the nihilism), but not all at the the same and with this level of grace and depth.  Nier Automata is a game where every single one of these questions is explored to their maximum extent. It doesnt offer easy answers and the hard ones it does offer often come with an heavy cost. The main characters (2B, 9S and A2) are trapped inside an infinite cycle of brutal violence and they, along with the player, are culprits in moving that same wheel.   Yoko Taro finally found team talented enough to truly deliver on his ambitious vision (papa bless Platinum Games): A game where its mechanics and design are heavily intertwined with its themes and concepts. As an aspiring game developer, this is what I call the main goal of game design.  I truly believe this to be a masterpiece and a landmark in videogame history. Its one of those games that seeps in to your brain and never leaves it.   NOTE / MINI-RANT:  I hate that this game was overshadowed by Zelda and Mario last year. Not to descredit them, but here we have a game that tried to push the medium beyond its known limits and it was overshadowed when award season came by the gamiest of gamiest.;11208;;A good portion of the side quests follow the fetch quest formula.

They added a few mechanics mostly relating to bat-tech which make you feel pretty bat-like.  I just wish Id had more chances to fight from the shadows rather than get in open fist/firefights.  The main problem was that its the same engine telltale use for everything. The models and scenery look great but animations are stilted and I dropped frames a fair bit. Also theres not challenge in it. If you miss QTE prompts it either just sits there waiting for you or you suceed anyway.

The voice acting was well done. The story was really interesting, it revolves around artificial intelligence and one robots quest to save its master, but it is short and doesnt show off much variety.

2586;;Read any interview with Josef Fares and youll be happily nodding along. Fares, the man behind the 2013 indie hit Brothers: The Tale of Two Sons, has a lot to say about taking risks:  I love taking risks. Like the fact this is co-op only - from the beginning, people were like, Isnt that risky? Wont you sell less? I dont care. Thats the vision, so I will follow it.  Theres something to be said about creative vision of one person. Hugely successful books are work of sole authors (with editors help), music generally works the same. In movies you have great directors who work hand in hand with the the crew to make their vision a reality.  Yet videogames industry still seem to be missing these strong leaders and rather pushes out highly calculated produce. You have the likes of Hideo Kojima or David Cage, where you feel the presence of personality in their work. Whatever the quality of the work is, it is important to have this individual artistry present in the industry. Josef Fares will likely expand this club.  A Way Out, latest creation of Faress small 50-people studio Hazelight does some justice to his words. The game is cinematically on par with Uncharted, clearly showcasing the background of a movie director. On top of that its co-op only, ideally played locally with your friend, or online with an unknown fiend. All with fraction of the a big game budget. Risks taken indeed!  Co-op only means splitscreen at all times. Having just half the usual screenspace to compose a shot is difficult, but Hazelight have done a tremendous job. Camera is well directed, shifts around and gives focus where and when needed, never taking away control when undesired. Overall game direction works hand in hand with level design to make for an enjoyable experience. It sure helps that the game looks great, although it might have skimmed the budget for animators all too much.  Sadly risks taken must be felt somewhere and dont always pay off. Unevenly spread out budget and a strong movie director approach make A Way Out miss the mark on just about every other part that makes a videogame a videogame.  Music and sound is overly subtle to almost nonexistent. Prison, where the story begins is one of the quietest places I have ever visited and things dont change much from there. The eariness of sound design is easily matched by what just about any characters say or even have to say. Both protagonists, script and the story are cliched, predictable with no depth. Fares injects his down to earth persona to make the story believable, failing to take the risks, making the story plain boring.  Its sad to be writing these words, since pathos at the end of Brothers, remains my favorite example of an impactful game design. A Way Out is doing a riff of the same thing, but misses the mark, because of failing to build meaningful relationships between protagonists and the player.  The game tries hard to entrap you into caring by utilizing moral values of family, duty, responsibility, but it just never gets there. The best component it has at its disposal - the interaction - never properly uses and rather relies on linear story telling.  Bits of interactions between the co-op players are interesting, but if you have seen the initial E3 trailer, you have seen them all. During the six hours or so to get through the game you are required to work together often. Being a very casual game no risks were taken on the skill required, limiting the toolshed of mechanics designers can use. That left the game to rely on quick time events and generous healthbar during action sequences and dumbed down limited options during adventuring.  At the same time theres a lot and not much to do. Every level gives you and your co-op partner great many bonding opportunities. Hobble a piece of wood in the prison workshop by pressing a button. Do a bunch of pushups by mashing buttons harder and harder. Play piano, arcade voleyball, basketball or baseball.  Nothing you do, from exchanging a couple lines with random characters to various interactions with the environment has much impact or purpose. It all feels like a filler. Even more so it feels like a missed opportunity, of trying to bond the players as much as possible.  Skimmed. Thats what the game feels like. Not unfinished, just skimmed. And no one really likes watery milk.  You might look at the publisher (EA) and start pointing fingers, but youd be wrong. Fares said himself:  EA obviously have this reputation of being hated, but I havent had any problem at all... When they have a question, I answer. If they have an idea I dont like, I say no. Not a single detail in A Way Out has been decided if I dont say yes to it.  This obviously doesnt say how Fares approaches compromises. Hazelight is a new studio and A Way Out is a new IP. Rather than getting consumed by the hunt for perfection, the Achilles heel of every creative, someone at Hazelight knows when and how much to cut down to get it done. The next time can be bigger and better.  At the end of the day, A Way Out is an approachable casual action adventure game for two. It has little new to offer game design or story wise. Still youd search hard to find a similar game out there. That being said it doesnt necessarily make it worth recommending.;36897;;Cliched story Overly boring gameplay Music and sound design;;Voice acting Co-op only Camera and visuals;c;31902;170074

2609;;Visit us at https://theprogamer.co.uk/extinction-review for the review.  You can see easily from the trailers and footage that Extinction is going to be taken a few pages out of Shadow of the Colossus. This was a given. But it also looks very similar to the Attack on Titan games, the slow-mo, the next cutting to kill, taking off the ogres feet, it did have some epic moments to remember. Although the world is big and quite platform-y, it’s definitely a full-on hack-and-slash title. But there are a few downsides to the game.  Each level is different. It will vary from saving a certain amount of civilians. Or there is an objective that this ogre or a certain amount of ogres are running around and you have to kill them. Even your typical tower defense type objective is in there. ‘Protect this building at all costs’. Quite typical of a game as such. Nothing really new.  The main premise is that ogres bigger than the screen you’re playing on are to wipe out all of the human race. Without spoiling it, I won’t go into detail why, this is something that is told throughout, the story which took me about 10 hours to complete. These ogres are called Ravenii, and the way to kill them is in a very Attack on Titan-esque way. You cut them at their neck. But sometimes it’s not as easy as that. You’re a human that has to make their way up there first. Some ogres will prevent this, some are dumb enough to let it happen, some you have to cut their legs off to bring them down and some even have armour pieces covering these limbs. Not as quite straightforward as you think. However, this isn’t always a great experience.  When fighting an ogre it can be quite frustrating, it’s not perfect to climb up the ogres back. I found that I fell off at times where I shouldn’t have, this happened all to often and got me frustrated. There had been a few glitches also where I had got stuck in areas of the, not stuck where I can’t move, but more than the camera angle was very PlayStation 2. It was jumping around a bit when hitting an invisible wall which would throw you off your location and made you fall, or miss a jump, or even just get yourself killed cause you can’t see the ogre attacking. This is merely because of the size of the ogre and sometimes glitches on the camera. There is something satisfying about killing an ogre. The slow more to the next, the reward from killing that ogre, just that slice to the next watching a 300-foot ogre come crashing down. Just surreal.  Although there is killing massive ogres, you have their little minions on the ground that you have also fight. Little mini-ravenii. The fighting style here is different to actually fighting a giant ogre (of course). It’s very platform game fighting, hack-and-slash with some elements taking from God of War. You have you jumping around, you flashy sword, you even have zip lines to help dart around the map to help you get there faster. I felt that, when fighting little cretins around the map, I just had to button mash. Nothing really to it, just press the right button and do the right damage. There is some slight changes to the mini-ravenii, you have normal easy one. Taller and smaller ones to mix it up a bit. Some that fly. Nothing hugely different and again just felt like I needed to button mash to kill these.  Avil, who is the main character in the game, does have a skill tree and can be upgraded which is a given, it’s nice to have these elements just to add extra little bits to the game and not always the same combat that you see him swinging his weapon around like a madman.  I do think the biggest point of the game, and I can openly admit to this, is the quality of the graphics. It’s very cartoon-like but it’s perfect for such a game. You’re a human being that, when next an ogre, looks unnatural and, of course, giant ogres roaming around. With the cartoony feel, it doesn’t take the seriousness away from the game, they’re still evil as before. The backgrounds are beautiful. Nice cloudy blue skies with some mountains in the background with the sun blaring down while you hack an ogre’s neck, definitely set the tone, but also makes it feel like, or even makes me feel a little bit better and epic when fighting these ogres.  I think overall Extinction isn’t a terrible game, but not great. It has its moments of epicness, making you feel like some sort of super-warrior but these due down quite quickly when it does slightly come a bit repetitive. The beautiful, cartoon-like graphics is the biggest selling point alongside your character, Avil, jumping around definitely gives off the right vibe. It just felt like I was doing the same types of missions over and over again and nothing really changed other than the story. The bosses were pretty much the same, the small minions were there same. Nothing really changed over time. Definitely a fun little game, and it does work with very little problems. All in all, it’s ok, not worth an AAA asking price however.;36651;;Quite Repetitive AAA Price Point Poor Camera Angles Nothing New;;Beautiful Graphics Can be fun at first Great Story;c;33467;172733
2611;;Its been a long while since I last played a JRPG and with my interest piqued in last years release of Persona 5, I figured I would finally make a concerted effort to delve into this series. Ive attempted to finish Persona 3 three times in the past since it originally came out in 2007 but always got distracted by other games or life events at the time. Now that I finally finished it I cant help but wonder if would have enjoyed this more had I finished it back in the 00s.   I still enjoyed it for the most part, but I wonder now that maybe Ive absorbed the newer trends in gaming to the point now Ive been too spoiled to go back and enjoy something like Persona 3 as it was viewed at the time of its release. Admittedly, some of the dungeon crawling and grinding got to be a slog at times. I know there are genres of games that make these aspects the central premise, so maybe thats something thats just not for me.  I know a lot of people heap on tons of praise of Persona 4 so Im hoping this makes for an appetizer to the main course that could be Persona 4.;11437;;Dungeon crawling can go on longer than necessary.

2612;;I love this game dearly, but I think that only hardcore fans of the series would truly appreciate it. The Zero Escape series is popular for its chilling twists and powerful atmosphere. Zero Time Dilemma manages to bring the series to a satisfying end  fans of the series should certainly pick it up. That being said, this game is nowhere near the level of its predecessors. The animation is cringey, the ending isnt all that wind-blowing, and, most of all, it relies too much on gore. Edgy death scenes dont make up for weak plot. But in the end, even a bad Zero Escape game still has a beautifully crafted story and memorable characters.;11549;;-Too much gore, inconsistent with previous entries (could be a pro for some people) -Explanation of ending is iffy -Amateur character animation;6;+Atmospheric soundtrack and visuals +Diana;Moxanthia Review;33166;170806
2613;;The beautiful music and great voice acting help the emotions feel real. Even though the story got a tad boring at points, the interesting characters always got it back on track. The story is mostly focused on the emotions, thoughts, and conversations between the characters, rather than worldbuilding. I would have enjoyed some more in-depth explanations about the setting.

2614;;This was not bad for the first VR anime ever (that Im aware of). It follows a story about the degradation of human thought and emotion in the age of AI, which is very important to think about as the AI will be descending upon us very shortly . . . Unfortunately, you experience this story through the eyes of one of the characters. This may not seem problematic at first, but it becomes apparent when they sit down and your perspective is forced into a position that you are currently not actually in (or vice versa if you watched the anime sitting). The screen freezes for a few seconds in-between every scene, as well. If you want a perfect, immersive film, this is not it. It feels a bit more like an experiment. There is certainly a long way to go in bringing anime to VR, but I deeply respect developer Spicy Tails for breaking the ice.   Also, regarding the price, I dont think Project Lux is for the average VR consumer. You probably want to be a fan of anime or really intrigued by the possibilities of VR storytelling to pick this up.;29955;;-Price -Odd forced perspectives;6;+Engaging story +Smooth animation and good looking models;Moxanthia Review;33166;170876

2616;;A simple, but charming puzzle platformer game thats definitely rough around the edges. While Im a sucker for the influences the game is pulling from for its art design, the gameplay is hard to overlook as it can feel like a platforming game from the early PS1 days. The main character you control has a floatiness to their weight that will make it easy to miscalculate jumps or slip off edges. A super short game, but Im glad it is as I would have probably found it to be even more frustrating to endure it longer.;3839;;Really janky in parts. Lots of framerate drops and screen tearing when moving the camera around.

2619;;Its a great game. Has very polished gameplay and beautiful music. The story was OK, but to be honest it wasnt spectacular by any means, it even felt cheap when it came to character development in the first part. Later it got some momentum, but not enough to carry its own weight. And a lot of plot points along the way seem unnecesarily obfuscated or even abandoned. Kind of like the writers could not decide what to focus on, forcing the story to multiple different directions and not fully commiting to any. Either way its still pretty interesting. Nevertheless, definitely worth playing.;11208;;The B route feels more like a burden and unnecessary gameplay extension than artistic storytelling mechanic.;;Music. Gameplay.;c;28084;173909
2620;;I loved this game very much. The game pulls off the metroidvania genre so well. I loved the way the story was fed to the player. The player can just simply go through, get a vague understanding of the story, or they can really dig deep to understand what happened and why your character is doing what he is doing.   The difficulty builds up, but only gets too hard if you are going out of the way to challenge yourself with some of the side areas, especially the Path of Pain. (Probably one of my favorite areas of the game because it really pushes your ability over the mechanics of the game).   The music really enhances the tone of the game. Its beautiful, haunting, and intriguing. The art is cute, but works so well. Id also say that I loved the interactions with the world, the characters, and how cohesive the world felt. Team Cherry did a great job here.;14593;;Nothing too bad, but I did have times where Id be heading to what I thought was the goal, only to realize I couldnt quite go that way. It never impacted my experience too badly, but I did have those moments.  Even though I loved the story, it may be something that is too vague for most, it takes some digging.;;Great combat and tight movement controls. Beautiful art and music.

2621;;Im sorry for having missed out on putting this on my Best of 2017 List. It was a charming  game and even enlightening in some way. Between this and Hellblade, it really provides some perspective on mental health, something thats been really been beyond me and something I want to sympathize with and learn more about.   Beyond the serious subject matter, it addresses the realities in a genuine and charming way that anyone from a small town can enjoy and identify with. The writing is quick-witted in a dumb and hilarious way, the use of anthropomorphic animals was a smart decision that makes everything more engaging, and the animation is extremely fluid for something with simplistic appearance.  Only complaints I can think of is the gaming aspect of it all can be limiting and some of the weird little bits of mini-games and interactivity feel like an afterthought, but cutesy at times. And the main character can be aggravating at times, but she grows on you.;10148;;Gaming aspects can be a little too simplistic at times;;Art design and animation, soundtrack, writing;c;29411;173943

2624;;I have a hard time placing this as a 7 or 8 out of 10. Its right in that sweet spot between the two for me. This game is definitely within the same realm as some walking-simulators, but it grabbed my attention a little better than most. It has some more elements of game play to it than just walking around, but for the most part, youre just enjoying the story, and the melancholy atmosphere.   This game hits a little close to home. It captures the feeling of someone in their 20s very well. Have/havent gone to college, dropped out/finished college, etc. Its just mainly about what your life direction is, which is a very big topic for someone in that age range.   Outside of that, the game is very simple, it doesnt do a ton to stand out other than having a good art style, music, and story. Id say the one section where its lacking is probably game play. I never felt bored, but I did feel like a lot of the gamey elements were shallow, and just there as a simple deviation from the monotonous walking and talking. (Which actually worked pretty well, as shallow as they were).   If anything, this is an 8 to 9 hour experience that Id recommend to anyone who is in their 20s, and doesnt want something mechanically challenging. Its a nice, sit back and enjoy the story type of game.;10148;;Some of the game elements feel shallow, and could be a little deeper.

2627;;A wonderful experience all around and it reminded me of what it is I love about video games. Its quick and simple, but challenging where it needs to be so that it feels like a great accomplishment when you complete specific areas and challenges. The story is especially arresting with the themes it addresses after first presenting itself as a simple barebones conceit of attempting the challenge of climbing a mountain. I would love to sit down with this even more to complete the additional challenges if I didnt have more games to get to. Possible early contender for my Game of the Year.;26226;;The frustration that comes with repetitive trial-and-error approaches, but honestly thats to be expected in these kinds of games.;;The visuals, the soundtrack, the surprisingly deep story in such a simple and pure package.;c;29411;174856

It has a story that would be bad even for Fast and Furious, cutscenes with terrible lip syncing and theres always someone talking during races. But there are few good things too.

Not the best pixel art ever but still good with a dark aesthetic that along with the sound desgin created a foreboding mood throughout.

2644;;First of all, I am not huge into puzzle games. I generally enjoy puzzles IN games but this genre usually a miss for me. With that said, I have tried several times to get into this game and I cannot make myself like it. I enjoy the beginning. The basic puzzle mechanic is nice and simple. Coupled with the various monsters you send into battle and their different attacks, it is a good concept. But then the game starts to gradually introduce so many “un-fun” mechanics that take all the enjoyment out of it for me.

2647;;The game sold itself to me with the peculiar cartoonish style of characters on the cover, really. The more I played it, the clearly I saw that the developers wanted to do a take at Worms but with more stuff and not rip off the influential title. The result definitely had a spark of personality to it, but left an aftertaste of being unpolished. Predators, herbivores and primates make fierce combat on a sphere-shaped map...for reasons we will never know. Yes. The plot is kind of murky at best. And the visuals might tick some people off, although I loved the cartoony toxic outlook of the world. The spherical terrain you inhabit, although seemingly innovative, makes you cringe regularly. Shooting projectiles or throwing grenades at a distance is a nerve-consuming task, so most of the time you try to somehow navigate close to an enemy. And yeah, you get lost regularly, seemingly heading in the right direction only to realize that the objective was somewhere else. The human brain is more used to seemingly flat surfaces. So the whole small planet thing needs getting used to. Theres lots of weapons and gadgets, although some seem more useful than others. Characters are actually different and have their personal little traits that make a slight difference for the player but dont really unbalance the whole game mechanic. The voice acting seems weird and loud sometimes, but you get used to it pretty quick. Definitely a good perspective on the seemingly specific genre. Although this isnt a hit game, but its a little unrefined jewel with potential in it that no one ever took the pains to develop. Try it for the sake of getting a different angle at Worms. Try it for the sake of seeing clumsy but brave little decisions om gameplay mechanics and design. Try it for the funky animal characters. But try not to compare it to the market-dominating giants of today or of old time.;27967;;-Poor balance -Generally unrefined when it comes to details -Poor voice acting;;-Unusual visual design -Cartoonish characters with personality -Humorous approach -Wide range of weapons and gadgets;c;34341;179535
2648;;The game came absolutely under the radar for me. Only through the advice of a friend I decided to give the title a try and I could never expect so much atmospheric immersion from a dark little horse like this one. From the first moments the game pulls you into its alternative dark version of history. Through masterpiece sound track, decent character design and a guerilla war approach to combat this game nailed the feeling of gritty boots-on-the-ground combat better than CoD does today. Its funny how this game achieves alot with such limited arsenal of tools. Theres simple objectives to complete, but they give you the feeling that you really are a field commander of a rebel group and that your actions really do make an impact on the tide of this hidden war. The weapons are also few but each one feels polished and different from the rest, and all of them are pleasant to use. The maps are not that big, but they portray a good feeling of urban combat. Theres also plot, characters and atmosphere. Even a bit of humor. Although looking back, this game seems rather basic and clunky today, but back then it had the spark to ignite hours and hours of gameplay.;719;;-Limited replayability -Limited arsenal of weapons and gadgets;;-Wonderful soundtrack -Great design -Immersive atmosphere -Good graphics for that time;c;34341;179542
2649;;The one-of-a-kind state-of-the-art game that comes from a time when games were fun, young and wild. Although the idea was not new and far from groundbreaking, the way it was realized really made the big difference. No other game will ever have the same gut feeling that Carma gave you. It brought out the violent bastard in you and brought a sick little smile on your face as you plowed through crowds of intentionally annoying pedestrians on masterpiece killing machines. And it was Fun. The guilty kind of fun that made it even more fun. The bloody aspect aside, the title was really well-done. The world was relatively open and free to explore, giving you plenty of time to enjoy yourself in this sadistic sandbox of a racing game. It felt nice. It felt fresh. And most of all it felt like it was done right. While other racing games featured cars that were indestructible blocks of concrete, Carmageddon had a cool damage model. The car would twist and bend as the opponents rammed into you, causing it to look like a mess. That alone was enough to make it a hit. You could spend your time trashing opponents, splattering peds or plain racing (but who would want plain racing?) and the AI players would catch onto your gamestyle, as if knowing what path of race completion you chose. The only drawback of this game would be its lack of variety. You had 100 levels to grind through, and after a while the process really became repetitive. Cars could only randomly be acquired by sheer chance, which made things even worse, as you were, basically, limited to two nearly identical rides, hoping that at some point you would get lucky and the car you trashed would become yours. But all things considered, this was a solid hit. Way ahead of its time. Daring. Entertaining. Creative. A must play classic for everyone.;626;;-Repetitive mechanics -Random car acquiring;;-Fun bloody gameplay -Creative design -Damage system -Dark humour;c;34341;179555
2650;;After the initial success of the first title, Carmageddon 2 had quite a high level of expectations to meet. And it failed horribly. The age of 3-D has only began and the main feature was supposed to bring success could barely justify the resulting game. The edgy bulky graphics did not impress. The damage system, although improved, now made the rides feel awkwardly fragile, taking the fun out of the whole vehicular massacre concept. And then there were missions. Tedious progress-blocking tasks that seemed to be specifically designed to make the player cringe. The world felt small and simple in its structure, while the car designs seemed rushed and sketchy. As a result the sequel is overshadowed by the ancestor that is older and yet much better done.;951;;-Poor visuals -Unrefined damage system -Annoying missions every three levels -Poor map design;;-Cars can be bought;c;34341;179576

2653;;It is amazing how much this game manages to achieve with so little of available resources. It would be safe to say that this game comes from a time when the technology available to produce it was very basic and very limited in capabilities. It even had a separate version for DOS. Thus it is surprising how fun such an old under-the-radar title can be. You fight a war of humans versus martians and thats kind of the whole plot summed up. Start of with scratch, farm one resource, construct your all-in-one base of operations and spawn units to go attack your opponent. Thats it. And yet somewhere down there lies the potential for long drawn out battles with hundreds of units constantly fed into the grinder. Dont expect quick tactical skirmishes here. No. This is all about massive clashes of armies with constant reinforcements and slow pushing of front lines. The amount of units you get to choose from is pretty small. But its enough. Each unit has a specific purpose and it copes with it pretty well. Design is rather minimalistic but still likable and the game sounds, although rendered by old age tech, still manage to please the ear. They help immerse you into the atmosphere of this simple but cozy universe, and if you manage to look past the age of the title, youll definitely find a fun little experience that will cling to you for quite a while. Dark Colony is by no means a grand headliner title. But its a small well-balanced and carefully-made game that delivers on its potential. Im sure we could all learn a trick or two of making the best of what you have from this little fellow.;51199;;-Slow pace of battle -Spikes of difficulty in campaign -Little emphasis on tactics;;-Massive drawn out battles with hundreds of units -Immersive atmosphere -Peculiar unit and building design -Immersive sound;c;34341;179705
2654;;A simple but fun little racing game with no ambition beyond being a good racing game. You race through various typical sci-fi race tracks with the road taking on twisted curves, while you struggle to grab the right power-up and avoid being killed by other racers. This is actually a rare case of successful combination of shooting and driving. Your goal is always to come first, so shooting opponents off the track is not the winning strategy. But by constantly utilizing power-ups to your advantage you can manage to harass the opponents enough to secure the first position. Just remember that when youre first, everyone else will be targeting you. Add quick and sharp twists and turns of the track and you get quite a dynamic mixture of racing and vehicular combat. This game can hardly entertain you for a long while, but it definitely works for its buck while youre at it. Simple but pretty design, bearable sound and quite balanced game mechanics. A simple but entertaining racing title which is definitely worth a quick look.;51252;;-Lack of replayability -Limited amount of content (cars and tracks) -Only one racing mode;;-Likable vehicle and level design -Balanced power-up system -Thought-through combination of racing and vehicular combat;c;34341;179854
2655;;Blood 2 is a title that appeared right on the very edge when old school shooters like Duke Nuked 3D turned into what we know as shooters today, like CoD and Half-Life. And one could say this was an inbetween variant, or a missing link so to say. Blood 2 already had the proper 3-D graphics (although crude), yet the gameplay still was the standard shoot-everything-find-key-open-door-shoot-more experience. It was a last moment attempt to keep the formula of old shooters alive by renewing their look. And, although, the class of games changed forever since then, this title was still in its own way a success. But not due to mechanics or graphics, but more because of the atmosphere and creativity put into it. Blood (as you would guess from the title) is all about sadistic violence. And the title delivers on that perfectly. At the time it was a gust of fresh breeze to see a game like this, that gave close to zero craps about the possible social backlash it would cause. The level of bloody carnage in this game is hilariously high. Shooting people with bullets causes them to explode in chunks of flesh and gore. Want to restore some health? Eat a beating heart you just pulled out of a dead enemy. Or better yet - slice a civilian with a knife and take his freshly beating organ. The amount of guns you get to do your dirty job is at least twice the size you had in regular shooter titles, and most of them had nifty alternate firing modes. Throw in a dark and ominous atmosphere, add a portion of gritty demonic enemies, mix it up with a devilishly charismatic protagonist and sparkle the mixture with diabolical humor. What you get? Perhaps a serial killers fantasy come true or a meatgrinder that makes you smile. Whatever your take on Blood 2, one thing is certain - this is a game with a character. A personality that stands out and makes you remember it. It may be old and linear, but its still a bloody fun rollercoaster. The only downside would be the overshadowed cast of secondary characters...that are just there... And the often recycled locations that you run through over and over again, revisiting the place youve already been through. The boss fights are rather direct and blatant, although that is expected from a game of the era, and the ending is quite abrupt. But its still a solid chunk of bloody viscera, being what it was supposed to be in the first place - a chance to be a murderous douchebag while saving the world.;11265;;-Linear gameplay -Revisiting locations -Trivial plotline -Overshadowed cast of secondary characters -Abrupt ending;;-Bloody violence -Dark sense of humor -Ominous atmosphere -Charismatic protagonist -Good arsenal of weapons;c;34341;179707
2656;;The game is great and well worth the time, however things add up to make the gameplay of this fail in comparison to other Yakuza games. The recovering mechanic of bosses is frustratingly fast leading to tough fights gaining a large segment of health during a switch to the correct style. Gun style bosses become infuriating at higher difficulties, and some of the side quests just dont stand up.   This is by no means a thumbs down. The gameplay is still fun for the most part. The story fills in points of confusion in the original, the extra content is beyond most sandbox games, thanks in part to its smaller scope.   Recommended but does not live up to the levels of the previous release, Yakuza 0.;12595;;;;;c;8607;179381
2657;;Pretty fun game, with friends at least. Game does get pretty boring towards the end since most encounters become just running around an arena gunning down bone boys for increasingly longer time. Weapons arent that fun after a while, except cannon that thing is hella rad.   Its a pretty short game but not short enough, last hour really felt like driving a car while trying to fight dozing off. Atleast last boss makes it worth it.

It is full of huge areas full of enemies and... well more enemies.To be honest textures are fantastic.   If you have played first game, there isnt anything new here. Encounters keep getting longer like in the FE, except levels are longer now and so is the game. So by the time you get to the end the fights last for like 20 mins, even with 3 players. New weapons help a quite a bit.  There are some really great Easter eggs and secrets. some rooms are really greatly designed and add fun spin to mostly boring combat. Sound design is also pretty great, music gets you pumped up and all enemies sound distinct.  All in all, its a fun game to play while catching up with friends, and i will be using yell of headless kamikaze as my phone alarm clock.;13181;;-too long -not enough variety in enemies -makes you doze off towards the end;;-great secrets -good looking -good sound -new weapons are fun for a while;c;33964;180089

2660;;Does it live up to the hype? No, not in my opinion. I find that controls to be very awkward, I ran into quite a few game-breaking bugs where I would either be stuck room with no way out, stuck in the ground, and even loaded into what must have been a debug room. The game difficulty isnt great. Multiple points I would be loaded into an area with 3-5 enemies, at 13 health and would have to exploit the not-so-good AI in order to progress at all.  What I really like about half-life is that even though I know it is quite linear, it never felt like it, I felt like I was progressing instead of being guided in the right direction, heck one of the reasons I put this off was because the brief gameplay I did see lead me to believe my geographically-incapable head could not handle it.  Although I seem to be a bit unfair, this is just a warning not to think of this as the greatest of all time that it is paraded as, but a good FPS, and maybe my feelings on it are biased since I have already played the sequels, but that is a situation Im sure a large sum of people will be in.  Also this game is always in the sales and is well worth the small amount you can get it for;231;;- Awkward Momentum in controls can lead to frustrating platforming - Ran into a lot of potentially game-breaking bugs - Multiple Situations where you have to save/load until you perfect an area which breaks gameflow;;- Gameplay is solid - Fun Weapons - Front-based story makes the story light on the brain but engaging - Best must in valves gameography - A pioneer of the time;c;8607;180631

2663;;A wonderfully short game to experience that feels more sensory than sensical. It is an abstract experience with strange landscapes to venture through with all the fluid motions of a modern ballerina, which the mocap for this game translated well in presenting all these neat little ticks and extraneous motions that add personality to the players character. Despite its linear experience, the story is anything but as it unfolds through fragmented memories and metaphors that the player has to put together for what ends up being still an incomplete picture.

2664;;In the movie Dog Day Afternoon, John Cazales character is asked by Al Pacino where he would like to go in the world and that they could go anywhere that they want. After a long pause, Cazale responds with a bashful, Wyoming.  While meant as a humorous beat in the movie, I can now see the appeal. Firewatch captures a very grounded and personal drama in the wilds and beauty of a Wyoming national park. It gets categorized as another walking simulator, but the story is engaging enough and the environment even moreso. The game designers do a lot with a sparse cast and a wide open environment to build intriguing mysteries that took me back to the best aspects of the TV show Lost. Although, some might be disappointed in the games twists and reveals, if you can even call them that. Still, apart from the reality and mystery the game sets up, theres a lot to enjoy in the games writing as the conversation between characters feels very natural in its humor and awkwardness at times.  Firewatch accomplishes with an even hand a pleasant and down to Earth experience that inspires one to take a moment for introspection and come to grips with the reality of life while appreciating the splendor in the world.;9730;;-Some lag and long loading times on console.

If you have played it and are looking to scratch that particular nostalgia itch, then this is a very, very good way to do it. The game itself is good. Better than alright, but not great. Link to the past is better in almost every way possible, though Blossom tales brings a few niceties to the table. One or two of the puzzles can get brutal at times to the point that its worth just looking up, and the combat and general vibe can get old pretty quickly. Finished it anyway, and am glad I did.;27994;;;;;c;25224;182421

2669;Despite some major flaws, Ive been hooked on this game for a whole week. Ive enjoyed my time in Bohemia, and despite its bugs, clunky design and other technical issues, Its been one of the most enjoyable RPGs Ive played in a long while. Its take is refreshing and unique, even though Warhorse got lost in their REALISM philosophy. At the end of the day, despite all my grievances, I only have a hope that theyll learn form this, and make a better sequel some day. If so, we might have a new classic western RPG like The Witcher 3 on our hands. My suggestion for a potential sequel: Streamline, not dumb down. Keep the RPG elements, tweak the combat, and maybe lock some of the realism and save system behind a difficulty setting, so that more people can enjoy your game, because its certainly worth playing, but right now, not for everyone.;The RPG system is excellent. You might never become a overpowered god by the end, but youll notice a difference from being a common peasant, to somewhat semi-competent soldier by the end. A lot of RPG tend to forget that, and its a nice sense of progression. And that they forged it after The Elder Scrolls games, one of my favorite systems RPG, is no minus either. In fact, The Elder Scrolls could learn a thing or from this system. Also, Bohemia in the 1400s is an excellent setting, and having the game historically accurate without magic or monsters makes this such a refreshing experience contrarily to everything on the marked.  The overall graphics are really good. The lighting is atmospheric, the texture work is excellently detailed, and even if my system couldnt run it on max settings on PC, it still looked good. Performance wise it was a bit all over the place, but never unplayable.  The voice acting is a mixed bag. The principal cast all almost all well acted, especially Henry, but almost all the side characters lack the same attention. Far from the worst Ive heard, but noticeable. Much of the same can be said about the music. Its almost flawless in cut scenes and in big moments, but when exploring or in normal combat it becomes repetitive and unforgettable.  The animation, again like the music and voice acting, looks good in per-rendered cutscenes, but outside its stiff and extremely uncanny valley. The combat is easy to learn, hard to master like any good combat, only here it doesnt seem to always work. Its really clunky, the hit detection is really weird, and way too often feel like its hold together with duct tape.   As I said before, the game still lacks polish. Even though the most outrageous bugs have been fixed, its still far from finished. Also, the story has absolutely no surprises in store. Its predictable, uses way too many tired cliches. Some of the late game quest are so horrible designed and written it baffled me. Most of the characters are stereotypes of the worst kind, or not fetched out enough. The only two highlights are how you choose to play Henry, which is varied with a lot of options, and a certain priest... who I dont want to spoil for anyone, so Ill just leave it at that.  The side quest are for most of the time really lackluster and mindless, missing the simplest depth. Only a handheld of them felt worth doing, others only lead to regret. The games desire to put realism is admirable, but is ultimately to the games detriment. Good game design is “make it more realistic”, said no one ever. It just makes it even worse when the AI in the game is this dumb, and throws all realism unintentionally out the window.   Which brings us to the worst thing about this game: The goddamn saving system. I dont mind a save system like this, but in order to warrant it, your game needs to have a high polish, which the game in many cases doesnt have. The most outrageous example was when I was riding to a town, and my controller suddenly unplugged. The horse kept riding straight into a bandit camp. The horse got spooked, threw me off, and I was stabbed to death by the bandits. Normally I would find this funny, if it wasnt for the two hours of progress lost in the process. The same can be said about many bugged quests, game crashes, or a simple player mistakes like putting all your money into a chest for safekeeping, only to find it deleted and gone forever in the next. This saving system cost me 15000 grochen!!! To warrant a save system like this requires Naughty Dog/From Soft/Rockstar level of quality, something this game doesnt have, and never will. If I hadnt played with a save-anytime mod, I think I would have given up in the first ten hours.;4843;I picked up Kingdom Come: Deliverance again last week, after a really buggy start that made the game unplayable in February. First Ill say that the worst of them seem to be fixed, but the game is still in need of some polish. But I was able to finish the main story this time, and here are my thoughts:;Sub-par animation outside of cutscenes Combat only works occasionally Weak main story & boring side quests Way too much focus on realism The goddamn saving system!;6;A excellent RPG system An interesting and unique setting Some really good graphics Great protagonist Main cast has great voice acting Wonderful orchestral music;A realistic RPG that doesnt like you;760;183370
2670;;So i hadnt played any souls/souls-like games until i played this in 2018, 9 years after its release. To be honest i was expecting a badly aged clunky game, but its really tight. The combat is fun and you have a lot of options for how you want to play. Theres huge enemy variety and each world has a unique style, both in aesthetic and mechanics. It looks really good for a game that old, the art design is pretty cool. Everything looks bleak as hell, half the enemies are straight up disgusting.  The main thing that put me off playing for so long was how often I was told its insanley hard. Its definitely not an easy game but the hype was over the top. Every time I got sloppy the game punished me, I had to die quite a bit at points to figure out a strategy and there were times I lost a large amount of souls to tricky areas. However it never felt unfair, any time I failed it was either because there was something I hadnt learned about the game/figured out yet or because I was being cocky/not sticking to my strategy. So it was always my own fault and never a bs mechanic or glitch. I honestly felt like most of the character progression was skill not levelling and I never had to farm. This gave me a huge sense of achievement when I beat anything I found hard.;5619;;Aged a little.;;Challenging Aesthetic Variety;c;16595;183774

2672;;Ōkami is a highly and majestically beautiful game. The storyline is amazing as everything seems to tie in together, either by revealing a final purpose by the end of the game or through constant use throughout the game. The more than average holy-like characters seen, such as Amaterasu and Sakuya, can bring out much happiness from the player, though some at first can cause negative emotions to stir, such as Waka and Susanoo. There are also some mini-games strewn about, such as fishing, that, while sometimes mandatory, can be a good change of pace for those who get tired of the open world at some point and just want a break from it while still continuing the game. There are also quite a bit of side missions that, while some can end rather quickly, such as Ms. Orange, who is trying to dry laundry, some can take just about the whole game for completion. A good example of one like this that comes to mind is the Nameless Man and his pottery. Five times out of the game, you should visit him. More specifically, after a major boss, as this is around the time you can finally move on with the story. Each time you visit him, he may have a new pot ready, which you can take to an old guardian stone, five of which are scattered throughout Shinshu field, where he makes his home. When you complete certain tasks or revive the nature throughout the game, you earn Praise, which you can you to enhance your abilities. This game is phenomenal. I hope, if you havent, you try this game. You have to experience it for yourself.;1271;;;;The Celestial Brush and its Techniques The minigames The Revival of nature;c;34809;183879
2673;;Black Ops 1 is the introduction to the Black Ops Franchise (Call of Duty’s Greatest) and this game is a full on masterpiece. Every game mode is great, it’s interesting, scary, intense, it’s what every War game strives to be, but only a few succeed. This game does. I will review all content of this game, so this will be a very long review. But none the less, let’s get started.   Campaign: Now I haven’t finished the Campaign. But I got about half way in and it’s fantastic. I really like the campaign. It’s so intense. The storyline is fantastic and original, and very gripping. The only reason why I haven’t finished it is because I’m not a huge “campaign” kinda guy. It’s not the game, it’s me. But so far, Campaign is great.   Multiplayer: I think this game mode is super underrated. I love this Multiplayer and let me tell you guys why. First of all, the guns (once you level up) are great. I love creating classes with them and unlocking them. I like how you get money and you wisely have to unlock it. I like how you can change how your avatar looks for each class. If we’re talking gameplay wise, BO1 fits me. It has great and gripping Multiplayer battles. Great maps, and to top all of that off, you have 2 of the best maps in history. Nuke town, and Shooting Range.  Zombies: This is (so far) the best Zombies game ever. Every single map is great. Literally. I will play any of these maps and not care, there so great. I found it to be scary, intense, I found the characters to be interesting. It’s simple, it’s not confusing or very hugely structured. The zombies are actually scary, the hell-dogs are scary as well. The guns are great, the DLCS are worth buying. You go to the moon, you blow up a rocket, you do everything!   Overall, this game is fantastic and I love it. I don’t regret buying it, it’s so great. This is a game to go down in history.;545;;- People may argue that the DLCS are to much money - People can complain about the bad snipers, but IMO there fine.;12;- Zombies - Multiplayer  - Campaign  - Intensity  - Interesting Storyline - Great Action - Good Guns - Replayable;The Black Ops 1 Review (Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies Review);34907;184285
2674;;A remake of the NES game Dragon Quest IV (known as Dragon Warrior IV in North America), this game seeks to bring the classic JRPG into the DS with improved visuals and sound, as well as updating the gameplay with some of the conventions and quality of life improvements of modern Dragon Quest games. The gameplay follows the Dragon Quest template, which is quintessential turn-based JRPG gameplay  so while its nothing to write home about, here it is well executed and there is enough variety in enemies, weapon, abilities etc that it remains entertaining throughout the playtime of the game (provided you have enough patience for turn-based gameplay in the first place). The difficulty curve for the game is quite good as well  minus a few difficulty spikes at some bosses, you should be able to get through the game without needing to grind too much (something that tends to plague old-school JRPGs, which is one of the quality of life improvements for the DS remake, as the original NES version of this game was guilty of this). Of course, if you do choose to grind so you can completely trounce your enemies, that remains an option, and a few quality of life improvements, such as a character that has the ability to whistle to initiate a battle immediately, as well as speedy and responsive battle menus, make grinding more palatable than it may be in other JRPGs.  The story is pretty straightforward JRPG fare (the chosen one has to save the world), but its told in an interesting, and I imagine at the time of the original release unique, way. After a very brief introduction to the chosen one, you take control of the party members that will later accompany you on your journey in their own separate chapters that introduce them and explain how they will want to come to your aid later in the game. After each party member has had their introduction chapter (which take about 2-4 hours each), you rejoin the hero as they begin their journey and meet up with these companions. So the companions are already reasonably well fleshed out upon joining your party, which is nice. The downside to this type of storytelling approach is the flow of the game is a series of starts and stops for the first 15 hours or so. Just as you start to get level up one set of characters and get to some more challenging battles, the game puts you in the shoes of another character and starts you right back at level 1 with basic enemies. In creates a bit of a hump that players will have to overcome to get to the best part of the game, though long introductions are kind of a staple of the JRPG genre.  The remake also adds some more content to the game and story, in the form of a roughly 4-6 hour (depending on how much of the content you complete) post-game chapter. This additional content is well done and quite challenging to boot. Though this post-game chapter does add some more to the story, fleshing out the villains some more in particular, the developers also took the opportunity to have some fun with this additional chapter, injecting some rather out there elements, such as a particularly absurd boss fight that honestly is better experienced unspoiled.   The graphics are sprite based, which gives the game an old-school 16-bit look in line with the Dragon Quest series from V-VII (but more polished thanks to improved hardware). The art and monster designs are extremely well done, as one would expect from the Dragon Quest series. The sound and music is similarly well done, though this element isnt as standout as the art. The world is a pretty good size  initially exploration is quite linear, but once access to the ship is gained it opens up quite a bit. The game is usually pretty good about making sure you you at least have some clue as to where to go at any given point in the story while still letting you explore at your own pace. Oftentimes, exploring off the path like this can give you answers to clues you dont even have yet, though even with this in mind there are a few times throughout the journey where you may wander the world wondering where to go next.  Overall a very good comfort food JRPG and one of the better entries in the Dragon Quest series. The gameplay adheres very closely to tradition, which when combined with the visuals and sound give the game a decidedly old school feel. The story is well told, with likeable characters, but rather boilerplate (which is more a result of the time the game was original made). A recommended play for both fans of the Dragon Quest series, and old school RPGs.;1815;;Chapter-based structure of the story gives progression a very start and stop feel for the first 1/3rd of the game.;;Improved difficulty curve and reduced grinding requirements from the original and previous DQ games.

2679;;One of the best movie-to-game adaptations Ive played...which, however, isnt saying a lot. The game does a great job in continuing to build off of the Mad Max world that was last left off in Fury Road. And despite everything taking place in a dusty wasteland, the designers do a really good job in differentiating the separate areas and providing some specific sense of place to each one. Characters and language are also a good fit for the world. But the gameplay and progression is where it all makes the experience an awkward one. For a world that worships cars and engines to a religious degree, you would think the driving and car mechanics would be on point. Driving can get clumsy and frustrating, especially when you are forced to take the car into tight interiors (for those who have played it, remember going underground or that ONE race?). After Batman: Arkham Knight, Im getting the sense that Warner Brothers was somehow influencing Avalanche studios to make Mad Max even more like that game with its combat and strange tank segments.  Theres a lot to like here that gets me excited at the prospect of a sequel or something built off of this, but in the end it felt like too much of a grind especially when I just wanted to focus in on the main story quests and the game forces you to complete mostly unnecessary sidequests to meet requirements in order to progress.;2552;;Most vehicle-related gameplay, severe drops in framerate, grindy sidequesting required to progress main story.;;World building, overall aesthetic, characters, simple but satisfying combat system.;c;29411;186119
2680;If you want a challenging Action-RPG with a lot of weapons, armors, enemies and a deep lore? Pick this one!;The following review is in german from my Blog (nerdyfanboy.de):  Dark Souls 2. DARK. SOULS. ZWEI. Man muss das erstmal auf sich wirken lassen. Wow, es gibt tatsächlich einen Nachfolger von einem der genialsten Spiele unseres Jahrhunderts. Wie cool ist das denn?  Das dachte ich mir, als es angekündigt wurde. Ob sich meine Euphorie schließlich ausgezahlt hat oder ich mich vielleicht zu früh gefreut habe, sehen wir gleich.  Ein paar Infos am Rande: Dark Souls 2 erschien am 11. Mai 2014 auf quasi allen Plattformen. Der Xbox, Playse und auf dem PC. Später auch als Neuauflage (Scholar Of The First Sin) auf den Next-Gen-Konsolen. Mit einer Entwicklungszeit von ca. 2 Jahren erschuf From Software (Publisher: Bandai Namco Games ) ein weiteres Meisterwerk. Mit Titeln, wie Kings Field, Dark Souls oder Demons Souls kreierten sie bereits Meilensteine in der Historie der Videospiele. Auch das danach erschienene Bloodborne schlug wie ein geldbringender Meteor auf die Verkaufszahlen der PlayStation 4 ein. Und sie alle haben eines gemeinsam: Sie sind einfach mal fucking schwer! Gehasst von den einen, geliebt von den anderen hat die bei Kennern betitelte Souls-Reihe ein neues Genre erschaffen. Das einzigartige Gameplay ist extrem fesselnd, die Grafik ist seinen Zeiten gerecht und die Lore innerhalb der Spiele genial verpackt, so dass man sich einfach nur darin verlieren kann. Kurz gesagt, alles, was ein Spiel haben muss!  Aber jetzt möchte ich näher auf meine Erfahrungen mit Dark Souls 2 eingehen. Steht ja auch im Titel. Ein Freund von mir hatte sich das Spiel vorbestellt, damit es auch ja am Tag des Releases gezockt werden konnte. Wir haben uns bereits Wochen vorher bei mir verabredet, um richtig schön gechillt mit Jogger, Pizza, Cola und Chips das Wochenende bei mir durchzuzocken. Ohne, dass sich jemand von uns vorher groß gespoilert hat, wurde dies auch so umgesetzt.  Bereits als das Titelbild aufleuchtete, konnten wir vor Vorfreude und Aufregung kaum an uns halten. Und natürlich gab es Streitereien, wie der Charakter aussehen sollte. Obwohl es eigentlich egal ist, da man ihn eh nur von hinten sieht oder einen Helm trägt. In der Intro-Sequenz wird dem Spieler, nicht all zu subtil erklärt, dass man nun immer und immer wieder sterben würde. Und so kam es dann auch. Typisch Dark Souls eben. Denn als wir das Tutorial-Gebiet hinter uns hatten und im schönen Majula angekommen waren, haben wir den ersten großen Fehler begangen. Wir sind direkt dem Company of Champions-Covenant beigetreten. Dieser Bund macht das Spiel noch um einiges schwerer. Man muss es sogar gleich zwei Mal bestätigen, dass man beitreten möchte. Es fühlte sich aber eher so an: Bist du dir sicher? Bist du dir wirklich sicher? Alter, das ist Dark Souls 2, bist du dir wirklich sicher? Durch diesen Covenant wird das Spiel einfach mal noch schwerer, als es eigentlich schon ist. Dude, du willst das wirklich durchziehen oder? Wir sind trotzdem beigetreten. Ganz schön dumm von uns, würde ich mal sagen. Und so hat uns das Spiel gleich mal die Fresse poliert, um es milde auszudrücken.  Das erste Gebiet, der Wald der gefallenen Riesen, stellte sich als unerwartet schwierig heraus. Wir gingen gerade mal ein paar Schritte mit unserem Bettler, als schon der erste Tod auf uns wartete. Und dann der nächste. Und der nächste. Es ist ganz witzig, wenn man zum ersten Mal in Dark Souls 2 stirbt. Man bekommt direkt eine Trophäe mit dem Namen Willkommen in Dark Souls 2. Als wollten die Entwickler einem sagen Du hast es dir so ausgesucht. Viel Spaß damit! - während man hämisch von ihnen ausgelacht wird. Am Ende eines jeden Souls-Spiels kennt man im Prinzip alle Stellen und jeden Gegner in und auswendig. Man kann sich also bei erneutem Spielen auf gewisse Situationen vorbereiten. Doch wenn man es neu anfängt und noch dem Ich-Mache-Alles-Tausendmal-Schwerer-Covenant beitritt, stellt sich schnell die Frustration ein. Man hat irgendwie dieses gemischte Gefühl aus Angst, Ehrgeiz und Frust - dieses typische  Souls-Feeling eben. Bei Dark Souls 2 und seinen Verwandten hangelt man sich quasi von Checkpoint zu Checkpoint. Hat man ein Leuchtfeuer/Bonfire erreicht, geht es weiter zum nächsten. Sollte man auf dem Weg dorthin von einem Gegner niedergestreckt werden (und ich sag dir, das geht ziemlich schnell), fängt man wieder am letzten Bonfire an. Der Clou dabei ist, dass man alle bis dato gesammelten Seelen, die elementare Währung des Spiels, verliert und nur eine Chance hat, sie wieder einzusammeln. Stirbt man bei dem Versuch, sind die Seelen für immer passé und man kann von neuem anfangen zu  sammeln.  Dieser gemütliche Nachmittag entpuppte sich also als anstrengender Akt der Verzweiflung. Denn schon der Weg zum zweiten Bonfire war einfach nur Pain in the Ass. So viele Gegner, so wenig Energie. Und da komme ich auch schon zum ersten Punkt über den ich reden möchte. Die Gegnerzahlen. Es erscheint mir oft als unfair (in diesem eigentlich fair gestalteten Spiel), was Anzahl und Platzierung der Gegner betrifft. Man kommt oft an Situationen, in denen man gegen eine Horde an Gegnern kämpfen muss und nicht selten dabei alles verliert. Einfach, weil es die Mechanik des Spiels eine solche Massenprügelei nicht zulässt. Ich spreche zum Beispiel von der Ebene, auf der man ziemlich zum Anfang auf den ersten Heideritter trifft. Dort stehen Gegner nach und nach auf und greifen den Spieler an. Oder wenn man später die Tür in der Verlorenen Festung zum ersten Boss öffnet und einem sechs oder sieben von diesen Lanzensoldaten entgegen preschen. Es gibt einige Situationen, wo es mir eher negativ auffiel. Sicher kann man durch das richtige Triggern der Gegner, solche Massenkämpfe vermeiden. Schaue  ich mir aber die Vorgänger von Dark Souls 2 an, würde ich meinen, dass man es besser hätte lösen können. Lieber beiße ich mir die Zähne an einem einzelnen Gegner aus, weil sein Moveset fordernd ist, als wenn ich gegen fünf Idioten keinen einzigen Schlag lande, da sie die ganze Zeit mit dem selben Angriff auf mich eindreschen. Bild  Im Endeffekt haben wir unseren Fehler erkannt und sind aus dem Company of Champions-Covenant ausgetreten und konnten nun etwas entspannter voranschreiten. Es ist nämlich eigentlich auch nicht soo schwer, wie seine Vorgänger. Meiner Meinung nach. Vielleicht lehne ich mich mit dieser Behauptung auch zu weit aus dem Fenster. Immerhin habe ich mit Sicherheit 300+ Stunden in dem Spiel verbracht. Ich kenne daher, wie eben erwähnt, jedes Pattern von jedem Gegner, Fundorte der Items, Spawnpunkte der Phantome und so weiter. Es ist also wieder sehr subjektiv zu betrachten. Vielleicht sehen es andere Spieler auch vollkommen anders. Vielleicht würde ich es auch anders sehen, hätte ich mich einem der anderen Souls-Vertreter so intensiv gewidmet. Aber meiner Meinung nach gibt es mehrere Punkte, die diesen etwas heruntergefahrenen Schwierigkeitsgrad beweisen.  Zum einen erreicht man sehr schnell ein hohes Level und kann auch durch die Häufigkeit der Seelengefäße sein vergebenen Skillpunkte nach Belieben wieder neu verteilen. Hab ich mich beispielsweise bei Demons Souls verlevelt, heißt es Pech gehabt!. Bei Dark Souls 2 habe ich etliche Möglichkeiten meine Fehler auszubügeln. Weiterhin gibt es vor fast jedem Boss die mögliche Hilfe eines NPCs. Man kann seit der Scholar-Edition sogar zu viert kämpfen, was das Spiel deutlich vereinfacht. Wenn ich mich da an den Ziegendämon aus Dark Souls zurückerinnere - ja genau, dieser Mistkerl mit seinen zwei Hunden - da musste man ganz alleine durch. Ein weiterer Punkt ist das Verschwinden der normalen Gegner. Habe ich beispielsweise zehnmal gegen einen Alten Ritter in Heides Flammenturm gekämpft, erscheint er beim nächsten Besuch am Leuchtfeuer einfach nicht mehr. Damit haben sich die Entwickler wohl ein Hintertürchen offen gelassen, so dass niemand sagen kann, es sei unschaffbar. Es ist folglich für quasi jeden noch so schlechten Spieler zu schaffen. Dazu kommt die allgemeine Entfernung der Leuchtfeuer zueinander. Es gibt Situationen, in denen ich gerade mal eine Minute laufen musste und schon das nächste Bonfire erreicht habe. Teilweise stehen sie auch direkt vor dem Nebeltor des zu bekämpfenden Bosses. Zum Beispiel gibt es diesen Rattenhund im Türen des Pharros-Gebiet. Oder die Königliche Rattenvorhut im Heiligengrab. Oder Der Verkommene, einer der vier großen Bosse.  Versteht mich jetzt bloß nicht falsch. Trotz des wahrscheinlich faulen Designs mancher Passagen empfinde ich es aus spielerischer Sicht als angenehm. Die Frustrationsgrenze liegt eben weiter entfernt und man oft mehr Spielspaß. Natürlich ist dieses Belohnungsgefühl größer, wenn ich bei Dark Souls nach dem tausendsten Versuch Kalameet endlich erlegt habe, als mal eben am Habsucht-Dämon vorbeizutänzeln. Aber für mich funktioniert es irgendwie trotzdem. Ist ja nicht so, dass es in Dark Souls 2 auch ganz schöne Arschlöcher gibt. Ich denke da zum Beispiel an die Sentinels. Oder den Rauchritter. Oder Sinh, diesem Drachen am Ende des Gift-DLCs. Oder dem Schmelzer-Dämon, den es auch noch in einer beschisseneren Variante gibt. Oder dem One-Hit-Drachen am Ende des Drachenhorts. Oder den fliegenden Zebras in dem Schnee-und-Eis-DLC. Oder diese Zyklopen-Nashorn-Männer. Oder die Dudes, die auf einen zusprinten und sich dann in die Luft jagen. Oder der NPC aus dem Gift-DLC, kurz vor dem Bonfire des optionalen Bosses, der mit Loyds Talisman um sich wirft, damit man sich nicht mehr heilen kann. Oder Sir Alonne. Alles miese Fucker! Ich liebe es!  Das Geile an Dark Souls 2 ist auch, dass es so unfassbar viel Inhalt bietet. Es gibt eine unüberschaubare Menge an Waffen, Schildern, Rüstungen und Zaubern. Bei den Gegnern brauche ich gar nicht erst anfangen. Kein Wunder, dass man beim Zocken fast immer ein Wiki neben sich offen hat. Und das macht es meiner Meinung nach so spaßig. Man hat nicht nur das Spiel an sich, sondern auch dieses ganze Drumherum. Ich tausche mich mit Kumpels aus, ich durchsuche Foren und belese mich in Spieleberatern. Einfach, weil es so viel zu entdecken gibt und das Spiel versucht, es so gut wie möglich vor einem zu verstecken. Wenn ich da zum Beispiel an das Begehen der Riesen-Erinnerungen zurückdenke. Man bekommt von diesem riesigen Drachen ein Item geschenkt, mit dem man in Erinnerungen reisen kann. Man muss sich an bestimmte Stellen begeben und die versteinerten Riesen ansprechen. Danach wird eine kurze Sequenz getriggert und man verschwindet in deren Erinnerungen. Dort gibt es dann jeweils kurze Level zum spielen und man kommt in der Geschichte voran. Es wird einem aber in keinster Weise gesagt, dass sowas jetzt geht! Geschweige denn wo diese Riesen zu finden sind. Fast alle aus meinem Freundeskreis, die das Spiel auch spielten, befanden sich irgendwann an diesem Punkt. Und schon fing der Austausch und die Suche nach Antworten an. Es ist dann einfach so ein tolles Miteinander. Und es macht extrem viel Spaß, wenn man sich mit einem Game so beschäftigen kann. Vorausgesetzt man hat die Zeit. Das muss man natürlich auch ganz klar sagen: Man muss viel Zeit investieren, wenn man sich an Dark Souls 2 versucht. Ich persönlich habe das Spiel insgesamt fünfmal komplett durchgespielt, mehrere Lets Plays auf Youtube gesehen und etliche Podcasts darüber gehört. Es hat mich in seinen Bann gezogen und hält mich weiterhin fest.  Es ist auch immer interessant zu sehen, wie andere Spieler mit Dark Souls 2 umgehen. Wie ist ihr Spielstil? Eher aggressiv oder doch eher defensiv? Mehr auf Kraft geskillt oder lieber flink und beweglich? Magier oder Nahkämpfer? Wie sieht der Charakter aus? Was für eine Waffe wird benutzt? Welche Items werden eingesetzt? Es bietet einfach so viel und dann noch mehr!  Wenn man als Grafiker arbeitet, muss man einen Weg finden, sich in den sogenannten Tunnel zu arbeiten. Man versucht alles andere um sich herum auszublenden, damit man volle Konzentration erreicht. Und sowas geht bei mir persönlich am besten mit Musik. Musik, die einen in den Arbeitsfluss eintauchen lässt. So lasse ich beispielsweise oft klassische Werke von Videospielen durch meine Kopfhörer schallen. Von The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess über Super Mario Galaxy 2 bis hin zu - ihr erratet es sicher - dem Soundtrack von Dark Souls 2. In meiner Zeit in Berlin (Ende 2014) bei sMeet Communications GmbH habe ich es ständig angehabt. Das Intro-Thema ist dabei überwältigend, der Track im Kampf gegen die Gargoyles haut mich einfach nur um und bei Sir Alonnes-Thema brauche ich gar nicht erst anfangen. Einfach klasse! Das muss ich euch allgemein ans Herz legen. Der Soundtrack von Demons Souls, Dark Souls und Dark Souls 2 haben so viel Kraft und Stimmung. Man ist sofort wieder im Spiel.  Ihr seht - ich bin ein ganz schöner Fanboy und ich freue mich riesig auf den April, wenn Dark Souls 3 endlich rauskommt. Wenn es nur halb so gut wie dieses Spiel wird, ist das Spielejahr 2016 gerettet.;8222;I worked as a 2D/3D Artist on different Games and wrote some reviews on my personal Blog called nerdyfanboy.de;- sometimes lazy level design - not the best graphics - unfair enemy hordes;48;- great gameplay and controls - hundreds of hours of fun - nice working multiplayer - awesome soundtrack - many bosses;My personal review of my very favourite game (in german);34985;185040
2681;;Actually this is my favorite RPG Game ever. I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy saga, and I really liked ad lot the battle system of this game, so linear, so simple, loved the part when you have to press buttons at the right time (was a blast!), but what I loved the most is the storyline behind it, the characters and their shades, their powers, their destiny.  Im italian and another fact that helped me falling in love with this game is the italian dubbing on CGI scenes.  The story is huge, and when you play, it makes you feel like its a long journey alongside your best friends. (extreme longevity)  Nowadays I havent yet found a game that struck me as The legend of dragoon did.;3140;;poor graphics in battles scenarios (who cares?! it was 1999).;;Extreme longevity  Characters stories are great  Characters recovers their HP while defending in a turn  Combo in battles (press buttons at the right time!)  Italian dubbed dialogues in CGI scenes  Both Viragos and Dragons acient story  The good comes the bad and the bad comes the good.;c;33782;186197
2682;;An open world game with huge diversity & gigantic game-play features filled with ideas, where player cant find a way to escape but to complete all and everything the game had among its fractions as well as exploring each part of the game marked with particular atmosphere which not so presented by any similar emulators of any kind or time before.;28540;;;;ALL ASPECTS +++;c;14350;186325
2683;;A nice mood piece that puts aesthetic and environment over gameplay, which can be to its own detriment by having such minimal interactivity. However, given that it doesnt last very long it doesnt overstay its welcome and feels like sitting down to watch a movie, albeit a very abstract one that can be left to a lot of interpretation.;24051;;;;;c;29411;186832
2684;;A well made twin stick shooter rogue-lite. But not much more. It has quite a cool sci fi premise, which explains the respawning mechanic but it doesnt go any further than that. It drew me in with the idea of a cyberpunk aesthetic and exciting visuals but it looked very bland. All the weapons, enemies and gameplay were good but bland, there wasnt anything new in there.  This was a fun experience for sure and game me plenty of challenge, however there really was never anything special or unique here, Very forgettable game.;18954;;nothing to make it stand out;;tight mechanics and gameplay;c;16595;187041
2685;;If you liked old erepublik this is very similar and have very high active population, you may wanna join a big country at first to have more active community, some examples Spain, Peru, Argentina, China...

2686;;I had such high hopes or this game when I first saw the trailer, sadly it didnt met my expectations . Story was good but the game-play was awful due to poor navigation systems , Combat mechanics could have been way better . Animations are pretty bad and so is the voice acting  , What is really frustrating is that it has no fast travelling in an open world map , a lot of time is wasted just the find the way . and even the map isnt properly detailed ! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY No Stealth mechanics in a Vampire game !!!! NO blending in shadows, No Coffin scenes, no turning into bats , just straight up hack and slash .   This game had huge potential, but I really didnt get the satisfaction I had hoped . Overall an average game .;8729;;No fast traveling. No stealth ! Map isnt understandable. Map lacks details. No navigation HUD. Choppy combat animations. Terrible Voice acting.;6;Good Story. Character customization. Choice based outcome mechanics.;No Stealth mechanics in a Vampire game;35235;187523

2688;;So much has been said about this game  the story, characters, epicness of the music and gameplay… bottom line is it still lives up to the hype.  Is it better than FF7 to me since thats its only other real competition... in some ways.  Is it the best JRPG of all time?  Also, in some ways.  Its really easy at this point so Im biased but, in terms of package and the impact of that in one game, CT is Godlike, nearly unmatched and hopefully will be forever.  Score Breakdown  The Tale Story- 9/10 Pacing- 9/10 Characters- 9/10 Originality- 10/10 Linearity- 10/10 Length- 10/10 Epicness- 10/10  The Presentation Visuals- 9/10 Display- 8/10 Music- 10/10 Sound FX- 9/10  The Mechanics Ease of Use- 10/10 Innovation- 10/10 Replayability- 10/10;1802;;;;Originality- the concept of time travel had never and will never be explored, dissected, and evolved beyond what CT did. Linearity- with so many side quests to explore, everything feels necessary and available at any time making the journey feel filled to the brim with worthwhile content. Length- ironic that a game about time travel is also a game that could, at least for all intents and purposes, never end.  The story is short enough to never get old, but long enough to feel meaningful always. Epicness- save the world, save all time itself... you wont get any bigger than that when it comes to the universal scale CT takes on. Music- hands down, some of the best music ever created for any video game PERIOD.  While games like FFVII may have more orchestral tracks with higher production value, and FFVI might have more characters with their own individual, highly memorable tracks, CT comes close to being near perfect with the effect that every single piece of music in it contains. Ease of Use- never stifling to pick up by anyone, but robust enough not to be shallow, just another reason it transcends generations and is still seen as as perfect a game can get. Innovation- so many elements of the gameplay were cutting edge, from fighting enemies on screen to combining attacks, any game after that which would attempt something similar would simply be trying to rip CT off. Replayability- with so many endings, so much perfection from start to finish, this game will be played over and over again, until the end of time...;c;35313;188345
2689;;The 2nd best JRPG of all time after Chrono Trigger- nuff said.  Score Breakdown  The Tale Story- 10 Pacing- 7 Characters- 10 Originality- 10 Linearity- 7 Length- 7 Epicness- 10  The Presentation Visuals- 8 Display- 10 Music- 10 Sound FX- 7  The Mechanics Ease of Use- 9 Innovation- 10 Replayability- 10;427;;;;Story- rarely will you ever encounter a more meaningful tale in all of video game history.  Theres a reason it was and mostly still is touted as the greatest video game of all time- more than likely meaning it weaves the most compelling narrative ever told in gaming. Linearity- not too much, but certainly not too little, the amount of exploration is all worthwhile along the journey and provides some of the deepest side stories to help a tale as has ever been told. Epicness- nearly uncontested in terms of grand scope, the story of FFVII puts most other games to shame with how BIG and IMPORTANT it feels at all times.  Many games have end of the world type scenarios, but few feel as dire and necessary as this one. Ease of Use- probably the most accessible Final Fantasy for mainstream audiences, theres a good reason it broke down the barriers of the regular public when it came to introducing America and nay the World to JRPGs in the first place.;c;35313;188346
2690;;All I can say about this game is WOOOOW- this game truly is more than what it appears on the outside.  The music was amazing, the quest while straightforward had DEEP meaning behind it, totally blew away most of the conventions of Old School RPGs and even improved upon some aspects.  Granted, I played this on the True Pacifist route which gives the BEST ending of the game, and I even like that when I didnt quite get the good ending it made it REALLY easy to go back and finish it.  Im stunned how much I like this game overall.  I would give it a 10, if only if was a LITTLE longer and deeper in terms of gameplay, but otherwise this thing is a near masterpiece.

Extremely nuanced and wholly memorable all around. Originality- while the initial conceit of the story may seem trite, overall the narrative expands upon and moves towards areas other JRPGs and even other games never find their way to. Display- despite the rudimentary design choices, the types of clever and unexpected ways the game manipulates the simple designs is nothing short of astounding. Music- every single musical track in this game is, hands down, worthy of praise.  Some tracks even go beyond that into pure magic- an unreal feat given the limited use of instruments in general. Innovation- this game truly looks at the box that most JRPG tropes fall into, spins the box around, and flat out blows it up into a million pieces through myriad choices in game design that border on the Kojima realm.;c;35313;188347
2691;;That game was AWESOME- everything about it, the pacing, sound fx, graphics, just super fun and easy to play.  The story was super bombastic and ridiculous but I loved it.  Cant believe Ive never heard of it before.  One of the best beat em ups ever.

Moves fast from start to finish and never gets old. Originality- pure sci-fi fantasy hybrid, the sheer bizarre nature of the story is one to behold and wont easily be found elsewhere. Sound FX- the best arcade games tended to be the loudest and most ear-splitting- this is no exception with nothing but a cacophony of explosions and screams to delight.;c;35313;188348

Visuals- so much atmosphere, so much detail with every character and enemy.  For the PS3 era this was the pinnacle of getting everything right in the environment to near perfection. Sound FX- the voice acting alone would be worth a 10, but adding on top of that so many small audio details with each area that arises, you truly feel the intensity and terror coming at you. Innovation- not quite as traditional as Old School Survival Horror like the original Resident Evil, but unlike the current wave of shoot a bad guy, pick up his ammo that perfectly goes with your gun, it strikes a perfect balance between them.;c;35313;188349
2693;;This game is still amazing, Ive probably beaten it dozens of times at this point and its still good.  Great EVERYTHING- pretty short though- always leaves me wanting more!

Sound FX- for the SNES the amount of sound design involved here was astounding, fully engrossing you into the alien planet with every step Samus takes.;c;35313;188350
2694;;Ultra iconic, fast paced, and tons of easy fun- a LOT of nostalgia specifically behind this one but it still lives up to most of the hype- one of the funnest, easiest, and downright enjoyable beat em ups of all time.

2695;;Super fun and fast, easy to pick up and play, even beating it on the hardest path wasnt much of a problem (though of course I have tons of experience with it)- really great game overall with cringe worthy grahics at this point, but STELLAR replay and gameplay value- a classic.

Epicness- the grand scale with which the characters are forced to deal with, the events that have unspeakable consequences, and a villain of pure malice and world-destroying intent, mean this narrative is far bigger and deeper than most. Music- rarely will you find a cast of playable characters that each individually have their own themes, and to have all those themes be nuanced and memorable is astounding.;c;35313;188749

No fast travel, map markers are offset, lack of the minimap, toggling map on and off is slow and painful, randomly occurring custom markers are the opposite of helpful due to bad UI.  Its repetitive. It gets boring pretty fast. If you like to beat the games with all the side quests, with Vampyr just dont.  Its a typical console-first game. If you hate this approach, you will get angry a lot.;;IQ up before gaming! You have to be maximally focused on your choices (skills, answers, quest priorities...).

Originality- the setting is refreshingly novel.  The mystery of both the hall and everything haunting it speak volumes about the narrative that was being set up. Visuals- terrifyingly realistic, down to the simplest details of objects and lightning throughout.  Still impressive to this day to simply stroll through and marvel. Sound FX- the feeling of every bump, crackle, scream and whisper is heart stopping.  Chills dont begin to describe the visceral nightmare thats in store for you. Innovation- No demo in the history of gaming required the culminating of knowledge from so many that played it in order to scour for a solution to simply finish it.

2726;;A satisfying survival game that keeps its mechanics simple, but still challenges to where every death becomes a learning experience. I mustve died about 4 or 5 times in the beginning before I started to figure out the world and everything that is a danger to me.

2727;;Took me back to playing Limbo and Inside with the creepy atmosphere and non-verbal story development although not as quite as tight in the gameplay. The people/monsters inhabiting the world youre venturing through are truly disturbing with a subtle, but unsettling sound design that intensifies the experience. Its a short and easy playthrough, but not without its frustrations as the 2.5D aspects can really make it hard to line up jumps or get stuck on pieces of the environment, enough times where it will kill the momentum of the game.

Coming back to this game, I recall people stating the game was very difficult however I really had no problems up until the final fight (which was a mixture bad controls and bad design).

2749;;By far the best of the three Quintet Trilogy games.  Had a very deep, involving (though somewhat convoluted) story with fairly interesting and likable characters- some of which are based of real people which is pretty rare.

2787;;Ultmately, I liked some parts of this game- namely the graphics and music, but the gaemplay was frustrating  the hack and slash mixed with regular RPG type battle system was either too fast or too simplistic, and the sheer amount of random battles was RIDICULOUS, to the point that if I wasnt speeding up the battles I would never have wanted to beat this game.

One of the best for the time it was lauched.;2566;;I have none;;2D fighting, a lot of characters to choose, excellent multiplayer mode;c;35798;192433
2829;;For me is the best free team FPS available even 11 years later, I have had tons of hours of fun playing it with my friends, when you play it in competitive mode you really enjoy the game playing in team, team play is the main reason why this game was made for.;891;;i dont like the modified servers;;Free, online, team play;c;35798;192439
2831;;Good game with nice idea, but really needs a lot more to work on it, as its in current stage considered worthless to loose time and money on it.;34110;;No game play elements  No diversity  Very simple design;;;c;14350;192843
2832;;Very Pathetic Game play... Building mechanics is outrageously tiring for a newcomer.... Have to leave cant kill anyone ... die within seconds in solo...and have to do extensive grinding in Squad and being killed on first sight every single time.... Not that i consider myself such a bad player...its just Bad matchmaking and nonsense building mechanics ...  leaving for good...;1905;;Awful servers  Outrageous Match making High Ping (Seriously 2 servers across North america And Only one for Whole ASIA With Such a Wide Region and that too is placed somewhere at the edge of it in some unknown island nation)  Greedy cooperation.;;;c;10457;193464
2833;;Best Tactical game ever made, and in my opinion the games developers needs centuries to overcome such marvelous masterpiece.  Every details is amazing, no negative points at all.;6073;;NOTHING NIL  NON ZERO;;Every thing and all details are wonderful;c;14350;103343
2834;;So simple, yet very smart and elite 3D mind maze puzzles on Pac-Man style.;81935;;;;;c;14350;193810
2835;;A unique game about a pict warrior on a vision quest to save her love from hell. The twist is that she has a psychotic mental disorder (likely schizophrenia) and a history of trauma. The game puts you in her shoes, meaning you experience visual and auditory (voices) hallucinations, and are never sure what is a delusion and what is real. The game is very sensitive toward mental illness, they got several psychiatrists on board and consulted with mentally ill people to make sure its accurate and reflects the experiences of real people. Even the puzzles in the game where you look for patterns in your surroundings represent how a delusional person searches and finds patterns and connections that others see as coincidence.   The game looks amazing, the art style and visual effects work brilliantly. The sound design is great as well. The combat is fairly simple but fun and challenging. There wasnt a huge variety of enemies. However the combat isnt a main focus of the game and there are long stretches without combat, so this wasnt a problem at all. The variety of settings and game mechanics kept the game feeling fresh the whole way through.   Its a very well paced ans cinematic story, its gritty and deals with difficult/important subjects really well.;7603;;Combat wasnt hugely interesting Wasnt optimised fantastically so I had to drop some graphics settings down, however it still looked really good.;;Great representation of mental illness Good visuals Unique Cinematic, great story, well paced;c;16595;194195
2836;;Well, the story is great, but narrow... to be honest as a fan of Dishonored I really liked the game and the atmosphere. If you like Dishonored give it try, but do not expect the latest.;8729;;- too few weapons    - the repetitive state of healing the same people for like 10 times (type of useless grind)   - the biggest pain in the ass is the total lack of fast travel.;;- great story - splendid atmosphere;c;35988;194229
2837;;Great game all around. I have enjoyed the fast paced gameplay and the cyberpunk theme. The best soundtrack ever, really emerging.;18857;;- no customization - weapons, armours etc;;- gameplay  - soundtrack;c;35988;194311
2838;;I played the PSP version of this game and, linearly, this is the first FF game I would recommend. This is an enhanced version of the original FF in everyway except for maybe difficulty.  Although the Job system can seem overwhelming, building a team is quite effective, with new jobs being added later on. In terms of difficulty, nothing stood out as difficult except maybe Final Area + Final Boss. There also seems to be clearly better classes than others but finding these is part of the charm with easy switching allowing flexible decisions. Music was great and routing wasnt as difficult as the two prior numbered FF games. Dont skip it.;393;;;;;c;8607;194332
2839;;Just completed, and got to say even its short game but its genuine ideas and game-play innovations made it rich experience worthy to give it a try.;71957;;;;;c;14350;
2840;;I did not play the game when it came out, but when Dishoned 2 hit the market I decided to go though both of them and I was really stunned. You can check youtube for the brutal fast runs of the fans. The games is a solid 10.;533;;- not exactly open world;;- the story  - the gameplay  - great difficulty costumusation (you could even play without a hud)  - more than one approch per mission  - the interesting graphics;c;35988;194393
2841;;A great sequel to first game and I like how they developed the character options and their skills. One of the best games I have played.;11118;;;;;c;35988;194394
2842;;Not a terrible game, But I dont recommend  due lack of original ideas and interesting tasks, just ordinary simple platform game where player should jump here and there avoiding guards and obstacles.;8223;;- Overcomplicated controll - Nonfluid gameplay;;;c;14350;194395
2843;;I have tried to finish the game twice, but it gets too boring. The gameplay and fighting are great, but that just cannot save the game.;11590;;;;;c;35988;194396
2844;;Merly a physics Puzzles based on rotating few 3D shapes to have them form a block.  My points agaist it, that indie developers shall spend some more time to make other game-play elements  nice designes, fresh ideas, interesting sound tracks,menus, options,,,, Not just do coding for a game and drop it into steam market.  Hope all the best in future projects.;104252;;;;;c;14350;194397
2845;;This game pays tribute to the old school JRPG classics. However there are plenty of things wrong with it as well as plenty of amazing things too. Nothing in life is perfect and neither is this game. First off the combat system is hit or miss, literally and figuratively. Some people enjoy it, some people dont. Think of super mario RPG attack style. Hit the button at the right to deal a crit during attack, get bonus damage and hit chance. Hit the button at the right time to negate ALL damage and debuffs when guardian. If you cant do this, simply git gud.  The items in the game are very helpful. Nothing bad, but also nothing game breaking either. Use the items to make the game easier.  Side Quests are enjoyable and VERY rewarding. Nothing but praises there. The weapon system is odd,I would prefer to be able to swap weapons but there is no need, for each better weapon recipe increases all your stats. No need to go back to an older weapon once you forge ahead. No need to grind countless bosses either. All drops from all bosses are used in your crafting and you literally do not need to grind at all in order to craft legendary weapons. The mini games are decent. I personally cant get passed some of them because of bad hand eye coordination. However there are some that require no thought and senseless time wasting fun. Also the minigames provided excellent rewards via score system where you can trade in your scored points for nearly any consumable, material, or danaar.  This review may seem like praises so far but just like Billy Mays there is more. The maps look beautiful but however there are some collision issues in the game where it looks like you should be able to move to spot X but you cant because it just isnt part of the map. Some parts of the map are designed in a way that enemies hide behind an overhanging structure and you will not see them and walk into them unwillingly. Many of the dungeons have hinderances that make walking the map a chore and avoiding enemies or ambushing them difficult, but not impossible. See Finias and Ice Mountain.  The monster designs are great. Completely all orginal enemies besides the ugly harpies. Your magic abilities are VERY impactful, and beneficial to fighting. Actually needs thought to win so you can not just spam one move over and over unless you grind ahead. The characters are great, actual development whether or not you like the characters or not. Story line is decent, nothing too crazy, nothing too boring. Able to follow along with the story the entire time.  If you like JRPGs just get the damn game. Its a good game with great gameplay and story, hit or miss mechanics, challenging boss fights, and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Overall this game gets a 8/10;22387;;;;;c;36032;194412
2846;;This game brings me back to my classic PS1 days! SO much YES!  I spent a good amount of time waiting for a rpg/jrpg that could excite me on levels that most newer generations of games seem to lack. Legrand Legacy has restored my faith in rpgs and I cant get enough of the content it offers. The battles are nice and challenging with the different aspects of strengths vs weaknesses and perfect/good/bad altering how effective dmg is on top of the statuses. I find myself having moments I do have to grind, some may hate that, but I find it great, and if I use the features as intended I can grind pretty fast before moving on.  The story is unique to me, kinda used to keyholes n key blades, crystals, and such being a repeated process so much that, this game is a breath of fresh air. Even the bickering the characters get into just makes me shout YES all over the place. Most rpgs/jrpgs I come across are always lacking in character depth or run into a cliche of derpy hero or over shooting hero, and his allies. This level of bickering I have not come across often in rpgs. Some could find it annoying, but to me I say FINALLY! You cant build a good character relationship in a team of heroes without some degree of drama, and sometimes in life you NEVER solve problems with your co-workers, so why should a game have to be all happy sunshine party members getting along?  So many features I cant even begin to express how epic that makes me feel inside.. Dueling, war games, mini games beyond a couple, alchemy, the basic games features, and most of all the maps being hand drawn maps over typical tiled. Very happy with this game, and I hope this review helps anyone debating on if this is for them or not.  I cant tell ppl what they will or wont like, but for me this game is amazing, Im still playing it, and will continue till I got my fill!  Thank you for your time!  TL:DR - I love this game, get over it!  );22387;;-lots of dialogue  (non game related) -Any negative reviews about Aria, cause she is waifu for laifu!;;-Strong Character building -Great Sound Track -SO many MINI GAMES -Relate-able characters (Wish more rpgs could relate too) -So many features -Controller Support -Unique style Graphics  I love how this game ties many classic features from older jrpgs I love like Suikoden & Shadow Hearts, and gave them a fresh take. I know many could disagree, but I stand by my love of this game as a avid JRPG gamer since 1989. I look forward to future titles!;c;36033;194415

2848;;A beautiful homage to the memory of Final Fantasy 8 (my personal fave) and helps get us over FF8 not aging well in 20 years  With amazingly beautiful character and creature designs, beautifully painted backdrops and a surprisingly good, if a little long winded, story, this is perfect if you miss the old school FF style of game before they went action adventure/MMO  SemiSoft are also great devs that like to listen to criticism as much as praise and current reworking dialogue for the western audiences for the long winded issue I mentioned above  I DARE you not to fall in love with the characters!;22387;;sometimes long winded has the same issues old school Final Fantasys sometimes had, but we still love them;;Character and creature designs Great Story Great dev team;c;30805;194411
2850;;Experimental & artistic puzzles  Every level have number of cells to rearrange into a target structure by limited several moves.

2851;;Fortnite: Battle Royale is a fine game. Its probably the most fine game ever made. Not much about the game is especially bad, and not much about the game is especially good. Its well made and can be somewhat addictive at first, but personally I got tired of the randomness, poor variety and the lack of skill based match-making.;1905;;Randomness and poor variety: I hear a lot of people talk about how the random elements of the game help it remain exciting, but personally I found it frustrating mostly to the poor variety of weapons. Every weapon in the game is either an upgrade or a downgrade to the one you currently have, theres not really any room for experimentation. For example, theres no real reason to switch from a purple heavy shotgun to a purple tactical shotgun  because despite them being the same rarity, the heavy shotgun is just blatantly superior. There are many more weapons like this too (the Scar vs the M16, the pistol vs the silenced pistol, etc.). Variety aside, its hard to not feel cheated when you search an entire house and only find a green pistol and some bandages while the person next door finds a scar and shield potions.  The match-making: Most fights you get into are very one sided, meaning you either destroy your opponent or they destroy you. This, combined with the fact the the majority of the lower skilled player-base are only children, makes every kill feel more and more unsatisfying than the last.;6;Solid gameplay: Just about every single action you can make in this game feels fluid and well adjusted. Weapons are laser-accurate and feel just right. Hitboxes are very tight and almost never fail. Building is simple, yet very fleshed out. Its easy to learn but hard to master, and it can feel incredibly good to beat someone by out-building them.  Clean aesthetics: While this is somewhat subjective, it really feels good to play a shooter that for once isnt trying to be gritty and realistic looking. Enemies pop against the background and are easy to identify. You cant just lay down in a patch of grass in plain sight and just wait for an enemy to run into you  hiding doesnt feel cheap, and it actually feels quite rewarding to hide and ambush someone since you actually had to use your wits and didnt just have to hit Z key and instantly become hard to see.  Good performance: The game runs without a hitch and looks quite nice. This isnt normally something Id consider worthy of praise, but I think its worth mentioning with how pathetic most PC versions of games are these days.;c;35833;194916
2852;;Really it started to be a little bit boring playing this seriese from DONTNOD,   Life is strange first was amazing by all means and filled with wonderful imaginary innovations,  Before the storm  sequel nothing interesting or added values, and here comes Captain spirit, with nothing more than choosing pointed actions on some stuff from surroundings, to hear a related sentences lacking game-play elements or interactivity.  Really all hopes to get something better and differ from the upcoming LIS 2.;103283;;;;;c;14350;194920
2853;;The Crew 2 is a decent upgrade to the original video game. As it excels in a few places: beautiful graphics, amazing 3D map and decent vehicle customization, it also falls short in others: awful vehicle sound, sub-par driving experience and a dull storyline. Personally, I’ve never liked the driving experience of The Crew and I still don’t like it in The Crew 2. It feels like just an improved version of, perhaps, The Watch Dogs driving experience. I don’t think it is as fun as Need For Speed Payback or as realistic as Forza Horizon 3. It is somewhere in between, which I think I’ll never get accustomed to. This, and the fact that vehicles just don’t sound good enough is a deal breaker for me. I certainly won’t recommend this game to anyone.  You can checkout my full review here: https://www.haseeb-ahmed.com/2018/06/26/the-crew-2-review/;28856;;- Awful Vehicle Sound - Sub-par driving experience - Dull Storyline;;- Beautiful Graphics - Amazin 3D Map - Decent Vehicle Customization;c;35921;194837

2858;;If yesteryears arcade classics were made today, this game would be found in practically every arcade. This game is everything a 3D SHMUP needs to be. The controls (for Xbox, at least  I hadnt gotten a chance to play on PC) are simple and smooth, the visuals are vibrant and wonderful, and the soundtrack is beautiful. Any screenshot one might take of this game would be wallpaper-worthy were it not for the HUD, which is still amazing on its own. This game has quite some challenging and original enemies, and the difficulty levels are well balanced. Theres even plenty of alien humor to keep any player invested in whats going on with the story. All in all, this is truly a great arcade game.;15766;;Lack of ship customizability, short game length, inability to save progress;;Classic arcade feel, beautiful aesthetic, wonderful soundtrack;c;36225;195669
2859;;While certainly not lacking in its presentation, this sequel just doesnt feel as engaging or impactful as the previous entry. Part of it I think is the game getting into the trappings of modern gaming trends like crafting mechanics and creating the illusion of an open world setting. I still enjoyed it to some extent, but theres a hollowness here that left me detached in the way I might take in a popcorn movie. I didnt care so much for the main story and missions, however what I did enjoy was the tomb exploration and relic finding. I know that was a major complaint from the previous game so Its good to see them finally putting the tombs in Tomb Raider. Heres hoping the next one will create a nice balance between the first two games .;23331;;Loaded with uninteresting extras Unnecessary microtransactions Too many audio logs/journals that stop flow of game Relies too much on waves of enemies;;Clean presentation Exploration of wide open areas Engaging platforming segments;c;29411;195832

2864;;A nice little throwback to classic Castlevania games, frustrations and all. The game captures the spirit of its genre forebears while also updating nice features like switching party members and graphical flourishes that stand out from the 8-bit appearance. And like the Castlevania games that came before it, there will be plenty of dying and times where you will feel cheated, but the games still feels forgiving in the way of doling out lives and continuing at checkpoints to ease the difficulty. It almost feels uncharacteristically generous for a game like this, but after playing and unlocking Nightmare mode, Im guessing thats what the higher difficulty is for.;101176;;Can feel overly generous in its normal difficulty Feels too short, but admittedly it whets the appetite for the main Bloodstained game;;Has the right touchstones of a Castlevania-like  game while providing new features Has replay value despite its short length;c;29411;196408
2865;;Another Erotic video game, but it is far from an inventive or adventurous one.   Fragmented hot images acting as cut-scenes and hardly any direct character interaction combined with a series of annoying card battles.

I played it at the exact right time when I was into other murder mystery supernatural stuff in TV shows and books. 2. Got it cheap. 3.

Felt like a nice walk through the woods at times and was even a relief to know there wasnt any secret items to pick up along the way or anything like that. Just an easygoing straight shot to an emotionally impactful result. Controlling two characters at once was not daunting in any way either as the controls were kept very simple. Overall, just a nice, simple, and tightly executed experience.;1334;;-Camera control got a little awkward at times -The quick storytelling was at times a result of really forced moments (those who griped about the Eagles at the end of Lord of the Rings might take issue) -More personal moments between the brothers couldve been focused on to build up their relationship more.;;-Pleasant presentation -Simplicity in its controls and puzzles but not overly so -Emotional in its limited storytelling;c;29411;199998
2888;;The main campaign features 8 worlds (2 of which are completely optional) Each world has a selection of levels including a mini boss level, boss level and sometimes a boo house. Each level has 3 star coins to collect and many also feature hidden exits which can unlock bonus levels on the world map, or short cuts to a later point in the world or a new world entirely. So basically for those who are into 100% completion, this game has plenty for you. The amount of variety in all the levels is amazing and unique to this game as many later games in the New Super Mario Bros series come across as a bit samey. Here, each level experiments on its own cool mechanic or idea. Sometimes mechanics return later on in the game, but with added twists and challenges.   The boss fights are incredibly easy and there is no way to change the difficulty settings, aesthetically however they are all very unique to each world. I wish I could say the same thing about the mini boss, but Bowser Junior is the only one and fights with him were probably my least favourite part of the game. Incredibly boring and monotonous.  The Nintendo DS was probably the perfect platform for a revival of the 2D series, due to its easy pick up and play nature. However, the lack of a quick save feature damages the usefulness of the portable console since levels have to completed in sets of 3 or 4 before there is an option to save. In some cases in the later worlds I often found myself spending star coins to access toad houses, just so that I could have another opportunity to save my game. This system is definitely a throwback to more classic Mario games, but particularly on a portable console the save system needs to be easy to use and reliable.  Unlike future instalments, the original DS game has a healthy set of power ups which help the player but never feel over powered. The only thing I’d say is that I would have loved to come across more varied power ups in the levels. To get any power up other than a mushroom or fire flower often requires using road houses.  Obviously it’s a Mario game, so story is not the most important aspect. However, even for a Mario game the story of New Super Mario Bros is incredibly lacklustre.   Although it’s not the main point of the game, it’s also worth mentioning that it also comes with a really fun competitive multi player mode.;1076;New Super Mario Bros was one of the very first video games I played and the first The I played to completion back in 2006 on my brand new Nintendo DS. I have so many fond memories of playing this game, however even ignoring nostalgia it still has lots of good elements. However it also has many areas which are less than desirable.;- Lack of difficulty settings - Limited save options - Story - Underwhelming boss fights;20;- Replayability - Level variety - Fun multiplayer - Just a really fun time;Review: New Super Mario Bros.;36771;200145
2889;;First things first, this game is mind numbingly easy. Back when I played this I was far from an experienced or hardcore gamer, and I never saw a game over screen. The incredibly low difficulty is made even more apparent by the games obsession with coins. If you hadn’t guessed by the obnoxious box, which challenges you to collect 1 million of these gold discs, the main gimmick of this instalment are coins. Coins are everywhere and I have to admit collecting them and seeing that counter go up and up is incredibly satisfying. However, 100 coins still equals a 1 up, so by the end of world 1 I had 50+ lives. This is frustrating because lives have literally no value because the game is so easy!  This game also just comes across as lazy in a lot of areas. Instead of having 8 unique and varied worlds, the game features only 6 themed areas and then 2 worlds with no theming whatsoever other than the names flower and star. This is really only an aesthetics issue, but it just seems like laziness to me. Instead of having unique bosses, the game uses the Koopalings which suffer from the same issues as Bowser Junior from the first game, except that this time they are the ONLY bosses.  I have to admit in terms of individual levels the game does offer quite a lot of variety. The game experiments with many different concepts and ideas, and each mechanic is used enough and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome.  Graphically the game is very bland and uses the same plasticy looking graphics as the other New Super Mario Games. Other than one occasion at the end of the game, the game literally doesn’t use 3D at all. In fact the use of 3D damages the game by blurring all the backgrounds which actually look good.  Thankfully, the game does have a quick save feature which allows players on the go to create a temporary save point which can be used once at anytime.  The multiplayer is less than desirable. Instead of the competitive play mode from the original it uses the co-op mode from the wii version. However, instead of 4 players there are only 2, and even though you are playing on separate systems you are still limited to the same screen which makes co-op play very finicky and just not fun.;1080;New Super Mario Bros 2, released on the 3DS in 2012 is part of the series of revival 2D Mario games started on the Nintendo DS. Unlike predecessors this iteration does extremely little to further the series in a meaningful way and is bogged down by a number of flaws.;- Way too easy - Lack of creativity and variety  - Bland graphics - No use of 3D features - Finicky and frustrating multiplayer;;- Level design - Quick save system;Review: New Super Mario Bros. 2;36771;200146
2890;;Super Mario 3D land was the first 3D Mario to play in the same way as classic Mario, and this is both a blessing and a curse. I will always love and prefer the sandbox and open nature of 64 and sunshine, however I feel that the more classic style was a perfect fit for Nintendo’s new platform.   Although the game doesn’t feature a hub world or massive open levels like other 3D Mario’s, in terms of the number of levels it was certainly one of if not the biggest Mario games to date. The game featured 8 worlds in the main campaign and 8 more challenging bonus worlds once the credits have rolled. For completionists this game is loaded with new challenges even after you have rescued the princess from Bowser. On top of that, the challenge to get a golden flagpole on every level and collect the 3 star coins hidden in every stage means that there is rarely a time there isn’t anything to do.  The gameplay is classic Mario refined and at its best. Stomping goombas has never been more satisfying than it is in 3D land (atleast before odyssey came out). One problem I have with the basic controls though are that Mario only moves in 8 directions, even thought the full movement of the circle pad is available. This makes some missed jumps feel unfair and hard to judge. I love a challenging game, but I don’t like feeling ripped off. The use of a run button rather than having the circle pad be sensitive to different speeds also felt quite outdated, however this could be due to hardware limitations.  The level design is incredibly creative and varied. I love that the developers haven’t limited themselves to certain world themes as it allows each individual level to explore its creative mechanics and ideas, and also provides plenty of visual variety. However the game never reaches the same level of level design, creativity and variety as the galaxy games that came before it.  One area where the game really doesn’t do as well is the boss fights. The bosses consist of Bowser, Boom Boom and Pom Pom. I love when a game gives you unique and never before seen bosses, which requires a new way of thinking in-order to defeat it. The galaxy games were excellent at this, but 3D land uses the same 3 fights over and over again.  3D land uses the 3DS’s hardware features perfectly, and was the first game to truly justify the 3D effect. Gyroscope can be used at certain points in levels to spot secrets in the distance, Star coins and the goal. The 3D effect is honestly something I’ve struggled without in future Mario games due to its incredible usefulness here. Jumps feel so much more accurate and depth perception is much clearer. The game also has secret rooms with optical illusion type puzzles which can only be solved by using 3D which is cool.  The game lacks any kind of multiplayer mode which is fine considering the single player experience is so fleshed out, but is something worth noting.;1079;Super Mario 3D land, released for the 3DS in 2011 was the game that convinced me and many others to finally buy Nintendo’s new handheld. The spiritual successor to the galaxy games that was able to seamlessly blend 3D and 2D game looked amazing before it even hit store shelves, and although it wasn’t perfect it certainly didn’t disappoint.;- Slightly outdated controls - No multiplayer - Underwhelming bosses;;- Excellent use of 3D - Creative and varied level design - Streamlined gameplay is perfect for handheld. - So much replay ability and extra content;Review: Super Mario 3D Land;36771;200147
2891;;Metroid Prime tells the story of Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who crash lands on the planet Talon IV, and must now traverse and explore this deserted wasteland in order to restore her lost abilities and uncover what the mystery of the space pirates experimentation with Phazon, a type of radiation. On her travels Samus also discovers the history of the Chozo, the inhabitants of Talon IV before being wiped out in a monumental disaster. The best thing about Metroid Primes story is that it can be whatever you want it to be. You can go as in depth as you want. This is because the majority of the story is told through environmental cues all over Talon IV which Samus can scan with her visor for information on her surroundings, enemies,  and story elements. Those who put the effort in to scan everything will experience an epic story of an ancient race being wiped out and the mysterious poison that destroyed them. However, those who choose not to scan everything will still experience the games excellent atmospheric and environmental story telling. The scanning can often be tedious and can interrupt the flow of game play at times. It can also be frustrating because some things can only be scanned once and if you miss it you wont get the chance again. However, I dont see this as too much of an issue since scanning is completely optional and the overall experience isnt hindered. I would highly recommend scanning as much as possible on your first play through, but I cant imagine myself going to the effort on subsequent plays.  The game takes place in a first person perspective, except for when using the morph ball in which case the game shifts to third person. The game does involve shooting, however it is not the central purpose. In order to emphasise the focus on exploration rather than shooting, Samus has the ability to lock onto enemies which makes combat fast and intuitive. This in no way makes it easy, and there will still be plenty of foes which get the better of you. Most of the time when this happens and you die its not too punishing and takes you back to the most recent save station which minimises the amount of redoing the same thing as much as possible. However, there are some occasions, particularly in the Phazon Mines where the game forces you to go through 30-40 minute sequences without coming across a save station. Having to fight a boss at the end of these sequences and dying  is incredibly frustrating, and made me lose the motivation to play on multiple occasions. As much as I love this game and on the first time around every moment is exciting, the exciting pace is completely lost every time you are forced to redo an entire half hour of game play.   The moment to moment gameplay in Metroid Prime is an absolute joy. I immediately turned off the hint system and Im so glad I did because I got such a kick out of exploring the seemingly endless caves, corridors, forests and icy mountains of Talon IV. Opening door after door and traversing such a diverse landscape was satisfying throughout and never got old. The game felt like one great big massive Zelda dungeon with keys, bosses, mini bosses, enemies, puzzles and stunning sights and I loved it. The best area, Phendrana Drifts consists of many branching paths and had many diverse landscapes within it. On the other hand, Magmoor Caverns was the most linear of the areas and therefore was the least exciting but still enjoyable. Almost every enemy encounter was exciting. I say almost because I could have done without the Chozo Ghosts. The music that plays whenever they appear is so harrowing, and they are slow and painful to kill. Top that with the frequency in which enemies re spawn and you could have to fight these guys multiple times in the space of a couple minutes.  The one area where Metroid Prime gets the most criticism is the final fetch quest before the games ending, which is notorious for slowing the game down to a crawl right before the grand finale. Luckily, I was aware of this in advance and was able to alot of the collecting throughout the game which made it much less of an issue. Without spoiling too much, the finale was absolutely brilliant and consisted of two epic boss fights, and thankfully saving before both is an option so the game-play is never disrupted;1105;Metroid Prime, released for the Gamecube in 2002 is simply a masterpiece of gaming. The game is filled with atmosphere which creates a sense of isolation. Although I was late to get on the band wagon with this one, I couldnt put the controller down. I found myself completely immersed in this game from start to finish.;- Chozo ghosts - Some instances require you to go 30-40 minutes without saving, resulting in some incredibly punishing deaths.;21;- Optional Story - Atmosphere and environmental story telling - Simple and intuitive combat - Optional hint system - Just had a blast exploring and uncovering everything the game had to offer;Metroid Prime;36771;200157
2892;;i really like hoi4 i think its a good game with good graphics and it really tests your mind with the controls its definetly a challenge, the historical accuracy is amazing and plus you learn about history i really like it;15894;;the controls are a bit complicated;;it is really fun;c;36792;200189
2893;;Much like Breath of the Wild, the most recent addition to the series, Zelda 1 has an open world which is fully explorable the second the game starts. You can go anywhere, tackle pretty much any dungeon in any order, and collect as few or as many items as you want. It’s all up to you. You could even get away with not collecting a sword, but you’re gonna want to because the enemies in this game are merciless. On the overworld the worst you’ll have to deal with are Lynels, which at the start of the game can kill you in one or two hits. In the dungeons however the plethora of things that will make your life a living hell is enormous. Dark nuts and Wizrobes are the worst, and the game will spring 6 or 7 on you at once in the later dungeons. The at some points frustratingly high difficulty is not helped by the now outdated controls. Instead of swinging his sword Link only stabs in 4 directions, which enormously limits his attack range. This makes combat feel especially difficult and clunky because enemies move at such a high speed and some are only vulnerable at certain angles.  The Legend of Zelda’s overworld is filled with secret caves, items and ways to earn rupees. It’s a shame that finding any of this is agonisingly painful without a guide. In future Zelda games you need to look for different visual cues and changes in the environment, aswell as have an understanding of the game in order to find secrets. However, in Zelda 1 the locations where secrets are hidden are no different to anywhere else which makes it agonising to try to find anything without a guide because you might have to burn EVERY bush before you find the right one. What’s more, sometimes the secrets you find are bad secrets and you lose rupees. No player should have to spend hours burning bushes and bombing walls only for what you find to be bad or not worth it. This isn’t helped at all by the poor English translations. Some cryptic hints are made even more cryptic due to bad translations.;1022;The very first game in The Legend of Zelda franchise was released on the NES back in 1986.

2898;;beautiful game, decent concept, mediocre execution.  Please be warned, that this IS a walking sim with some puzzle elements and not an RPG or true fox sim (in that one is merely running and jumping, not hunting, eating, drinking, or surviving).  This game could have been something like a terrestrial Abzu but falls VERY short of that magnificent work of art.  The game is basically a walking-sim with seemingly unrelated (to the gameplay) dialogue between a couple who have recently experienced great loss as the male narrator describes different aspects of his difficult growing-up and overall life. This game would be good (its not bad, but it certainly isnt good) if the level design better matched the gameplay intention of the developer in that i imagine the game is supposed to be relatively easy and relaxing but instead can be very tedious and frustrating due to poor level design and lackluster controls.;20909;;poorly designed levels, tedious, frustrating, and very repetetive.;;beautiful graphics, good voice-acting;c;4224;201236

2902;Worth playing? Absolutely! Best Zelda game ever? I didnt think so personally.;Ah, tough one: Yes, its a good game. No, i didnt really love it :/  Everyone was very taken by the open world aspect, and i agree its refreshing absolutely, but i dont consider it the best part, yet alone the best selling point, of the game. I spent more time running and climbing than doing anything else :s   I was disappointed with the inventory aspect of the game, for me Zelda was always about acquiring new items to solve puzzles. Having all of them early one felt odd, and i didnt particularly love those runes, i wanted... more? The weapon system was also a bit bothersome to me, first of all they keep breaking which was infuriating, and secondly there are so many  i stopped paying attention to what i used pretty much. For example at a few points in the game youre rewarded with unique weapons but... theyre not that special at all compared to some others you find, and they still break anyway so i didnt really see the point?  I loved the cooking and brewing mechanics, but because there are no way to store recipes i found it quite confusing unfortunately. I pretty much stopped pretty early on to brew elixirs and only relied on cooking since that was the most intuitive to do without any guidance. There are plenty of posters scattered with recipes, so i didnt really get why taking a picture of them wouldnt save them for reuse?  Then, the voice acting. Im by no means a Zelda fanboy but regardless i thought this was completely unnecessary, it added nothing to the quests or the story and worse: it broke all the charm. Adding to this for some reason it felt more like a strange dubbing, I always pictured the series as a neutral and boundless example of video gaming, so when you suddenly make your characters sound like a Nickelodeon cartoon then.. yeah it was weird, and again completely unnecessary in my opinion. (note that i only realised after finishing the game that i could have switched to the Japanese VO, while i still wouldnt think it necessary i probably would have picked that if i had known).  Beside those points, its still a beautiful game. Its eerie, colourful, magical and full of intricate details! While i wasnt sold on some of the new gameplay mechanics, others i thought worked wonders, the shrines for example were great, and alongside the divine beasts the parts i enjoyed the most.   I Probably spent about 30 or so hours i think? And im aware i there is still a ton of more content for me to try (i think i only did 46 shrines) but i dont feel inspired to go back to it for some reason :/;7346;;The voice acting The weapon system the rain... crafting recipes;130;The shrines Graphics its a Zelda game!;Switch;3723;194087

To put it in perspective i dont even remember much of it to go into details (even though i played it in one sitting!). Something about sailors, submarine, ,something something.. spooky island?  Unfortunate for a heavily narrative driven game :/  Other than that i was really taken by the presentation, both the artstyle and even the sound design were great i though! it was spooky, eerie and still colourful, a surprising fit.;14587;I played Oxenfree in one sitting while on a plane trip, which was a perfect fit for it.;uncaptivating story;130;art style atmospere;A great empty shell;3723;166586

2906;Overall Sonic 06 might be one of my favorite games believe it or not and I would rate it highly on a subjective level due to the enjoyment that it brings me no matter what mood I am in.;Sonic 06 as you may know is a complete broken mess in many aspects,  But in retrospect is what makes the game worth visiting and even enjoyable.  The glitches can be used in speed-running or just to mess around in the hub.  The game has an odd sort of soft spot with its glitches, when playing unless you go out of your way to find them it isnt all that glitchy but if you feel adventurous you can break the game all you want.  In terms of actual qualities the presentation and music are naturally good as most modern SEGA games are.  The controls despite being overly sensitive are responsive and able to be adjusted to.  The loading times arent very fun but installing the game to your consoles hard drive does help decreasing them to around 5 - 13 seconds (in the case of the 360 version)  The levels whilst at some points being unimaginative are all fun to traverse through from the lush coast of Wave Ocean to the ruined Crisis City with the aforementioned music fitting them all very nicely.  However another negative note is the frame-rate, the frame-rate isnt as bad as something like jungle joyride in Sonic Unleashed but is still quite noticeable giving the game at times a slow motion effect.  Another complaint that you may have about the game is the speed of silver as he is quite slow but over time you do get used to his slower pace of game play, besides many glitches exist to quicken the pace of silvers levels such as the extended teleport dash and the ability to use your telekinetic lift on objects while standing on them to boost you far into the air and potentially to a further point in the stage.  People also complain about the shadow stages being rather repetitive with the combat not differing between each enemy you kill, this is indeed a valid complaint but due to the joys of 06 you can very easily clip through a wall into the next section turning it into a speed-run whilst making you feel like a hacker at the same time.;6231;Not delusional;Load times Plot First Playthrough;12;Controlls Music Gameplay Level Design Glitches;Broken, But isnt that the point?;24067;203884

2908;;I had a lot of fun with this. They totally nailed the coop gameplay, it felt awesome to pull off all these different things with a friend. Cinematically its one of the best games Ive seen. The scripted sequences are on point and hold their own against even great film cinematography. The story is good but nothing special most of the time. I really liked the ending, it felt like a great payoff for all of the game up to then and combined both a gameplay and narritive shift for a fantastic effect.   The voice acting is...interesting. Think Tommy Wiseau in The Room. Personally I loved it. So bad its good. But I cant see how people could find it off putting, especially as the rest of the game has such a high production value.  It ran really well and looked good on my PC. I also really respect their choice to let you play for free with someone who owns the game.  This is a truly unique game which creates the absolute best coop experience Ive ever had. If you can get past a few rough edges in the story and voice acting this is so much fun, especially if you enjoy prison break type of tv/films.;36897;;Odd voice acting (but i liked it) Derivative/ by the numbers story.;;Great cinematography.

2909;;Nothing like a high concept game. In headlander, you play as a disembodied floating head which attaches itself to various robot bodies in order to lead a resistance against the sci fi overlord. The gameplay is mostly platformer shootouts and floating around as a head. The combat isnt very varied and there wasnt much in the way of puzzling/platforming, at least nothing challenging. The game has quite a good vibe/art style but unfortunately I thought the graphics let it down, making it pretty ugly and everything just about looked the same. The story wasnt really much worth mentioning. There was the odd bit of quite good dialogue but again not much to write home about. All in all this just couldve been so much more. Its a really interesting idea for a game which fell pretty much flat through lackluster delivery and repetitive/unimaginative gameplay.

2914;;So in the end this game felt underwhelming for me.  The story just DID NOT suck me in at all, was far to open and slow at the beginning.

Plus the graphics were not consistant  sometimes they would look AMAZING, like in battle and walking around the world, but then it would get to a cutscene and have TONS of pup in and glitches happen- very odd and surprisingly no polished enough.

2920;;In this game you play as Mondo Zappa, an assassin who works for the Executioner Office, a (probably american?) goverment department that carries out assassination contracts with a worryingly low amount of bakground checks and seemingly zero oversight an accountability... Makes no sense? Dont worry, basically nothing about this game makes sense. Killer Is Dead is a game that does some things phenominally well, better than pretty much any other game Ive played. It also does some things atrociously, so bad at times I nearly gave up playing it.  Ill start with what it does best. Style. This game is bursting at the seams with great art and great aesthetic. Every single thing in this game looks amazing, even 5 years on. The game has a mixture of cyberpunk, noire and surrealism which, combined with a cell shaded art style, just works on every level. The detail they put into this blows my mind, the whole world shifts and changes along with the music (which I love) to match you sword blows. The basic enemies look like awesome corrupted pieces of scrap metal. The bosses are all unique and fantastically designed. My personal favourite is the yakuza boss, the fight against him stands up to the best martial arts films out there. The combat, while maybe a little simple is hugely rewarding. A well timed dodge results in time slowing down for you to slash madly and all the visual effects used make this feel amazing.   However there were time that the combat was also very badly implemeted. It felt like they forced the mechanics into situations it wasnt designed for and it doesnt scale well for higher difficulties, resulting in sections that are frankly just frustrating BS. Such as a segment where you are forced into a turret to take out enemy turrets but before you can do anything, other enemy smack you out of the turret and you cant get back in as they are endlessly spawning. The storytelling is just weird. Nothing is ever built up to, the game just flits disorientatingly from one thing to the next, with no explanations for anything at all. The dialogue is clunky (probably poor translation) and often doesnt even make sense. At other times it genuinely made me laugh and some scenes were dramatic and compelling, but I never felt invested in what was happening, because I basically didnt know what was happening or who anyone was. Plus Mondos sidekick Mika annoyed the hell out of me and jarred heavily with the rest of game with her weird kawaii crap.  The biggest issue I have with the game is the side content. Half of it is creepy mini games where you perv on women while they arent looking then buy them crap to win sex with them. Gross. The rest were mediocre rehashes of story levels and I never felt much need for them as the combat on its own, without the cool set pieces and cut scenes, isnt that much to shout about.  This is definitely worth playing as you can get it pretty cheap now and its such a unique game. Looking back I wish Id played the whole way through on normal difficulty, which isnt challenging but its very satisfying to tear through enemies like a demigod. This would have allowed me to truly enjoy the visuals and the style which are what this game is really about. And I wish Id ignored all of the side content as its a mixture of sexist trash and boring badly reused assets. If I had played the game in that way Id probably be rating it at least 8/10.;2940;;Dialogue Plot and storytelling Sexism Side content Higher difficulties badly designed;;Visuals Art style Aesthetic Music Satisfying and rewarding combat Enemy design Level design;c;16595;206606
2921;;Once a great indie AAA game is now a Chinese owned money making cow. Still a great thing to try and the game ideas are great, but it is a little overwhelming and really complex since they have added a lot of stuff for the past few years.;1911;;;;;c;35988;206773
2922;;The game should be called Reactivate 4 instead of Quake, because basically all the mission objectives are reactivate power ..., reactivate bridge ..., reactivate something else, but reactivate it!. I think Quake 4 could be a way more enjoyable game if it were much more compact. Like ... cut the reactivate-missions and gameplay sequences in half and maybe put more story work/action setpieces into it. It isnt terrible at all, I just felt kind of exhausted after a couple of hours, because except for a handful of missions (and there are like 30 of them) the battle scenes feel just like the first one in the beginning, almost without any mixup and with the same flow and environments. Like a joke you try to perfect over time, but the more often you tell it, the more annoyed people get who already heard it.;356;;;;;c;11973;206828

2924;;Probably the best Quantic Dream game to come out, but in Quantic Dream fashion there is always something awkward to navigate around the decent parts. The presentation is amazing to look out and the acting is probably the best its been in a David Cage production. Setting the game in a place like a futuristic Detroit while still recognizing its classic roots was refreshing to see when so many games seem to aim toward shiny and unrecognizable metropolises. The buddy cop dynamic of Hank and Connor was the best part and I wished the game concentrated on it more. Seeing the other side of their investigation from the perspective of Markus was a good approach but executed strangely. And the story of Kara, a domestic helper android, didnt feel connected enough and too parallel to what was going on.   The biggest issue in execution was how tone deaf the story was to American history. Its like the game felt like it was telling a groundbreaking story in civil rights when it was directly pulling from tumultuous times in history like the Holocaust and Jim Crow America in the mid 20th century, while completely not making any mention of it in the game.  But whats a Quanitc Dream game without fumbled story beats and awkward executions? It something that people have come to accept from them and even find charming in its own way, like finding enjoyment out of a bad movie. That said, its hard to completely hate the game when theres something be admire and enjoy here.;14362;;-Strangely handled plot beats that make the player think otherwise when advancing the character relationships. -Tone deaf storytelling that tries to pull from history without recognizing it. -One characters storyline that doesnt feel connected enough to everything thats going on.;;-The flowchart and being able to see diverging paths and start from various checkpoints in the story when replaying the game. -The graphics and presentation is some of the best on a Playstation console -The use of more appropriate performers for roles in the game that dont give way to awkward line readings and pronunciations.;c;29411;206848
2925;;Another very interesting storyline by Wadjet Eye games. This time were in a postapocaliptic dystopia where some bomds has destroyed the world.

The puzzles are smart and are based in logic. The atmosphere is quite fitting.;16478;;;;;c;4225;206853
2926;;I should first say that this game does succeed at doing exactly what it sets out for. I believe it deserves to exist as a story and theme that could have only been told in the way it was through video games, but I give it nothing else.  This is one of the worst experiences Ive had in a game. Each chapter can be boiled down into a different resource management minigame that often hides important information to the player through a clunky UI and sometimes requires guess work in order to figure out basic mechanics, to the extent that the vast majority of players will just brute force their way through levels instead. Even if you do manage to figure out each mode, random chance can often end or hamper runs without any player input, which further leads to the need to constantly retry the same tasks over and over until you get lucky and make it through. And the worst part is that its all intentional, and I have proof.  SPOILER WARNING  The big plot twist of the game is that whenever the main character dies, he wakes up many years ago with little knowledge of what has happened and has to try and save everyone again. This is supposed to reflect how you as a player have to go through the same mission over and over and over to barey squeeze by. The random bullshit that can end your runs despite perfect play are just the game being realistic, and the same can be said about the obtuse mechanics of each chapter. This is why I respect it as a piece of art. It manages to make this idea of trying over and over again to combat the harsh, confusing, and uncontrollable cruelty of life as youre stuck in this constant cycle of frustrating failure cross the gap from being simple ptatitudes and actually feel emotional, because *you* had to live through it. The only issue is that that exact thing also makes for some of the worst game design Ive ever played.  Im not touching this game again.;7543;;The gameplay is an unbearable slog that I never want to touch again, and the story does not make up for it.;;The game does manage to appropriately tackle its theme.;c;37591;206900
2927;;This game frequently teeters the line between difficult strategy and complete random bullshit. Often times the game will put you in scenarios where, from the very start of a mission and regardless of how well you positioned yourself, you simply cannot avoid taking a loss and have to accept the beating RNG gives you. Other times, the combat unfolds like a complicated puzzle of resource management, where the resource is your actions and how many different threats you can neutralize with your limited number. At its best, you can pull from the depths a perfect and unorthodox solution that perfectly diffuses the situation. A lot of this is thanks to the positioning system and how much of the combat revolves around using instead of just raw damage output to survive. While there are some amazing moments in this game they are few and far between.  The game also suffers from a severe lack of variety. While choosing your starting location varies the runs a little bit, there are clear options that are significantly harder or easier. On top of that, the vast majority of the other mechs you can purchase to start your runs with are either worse at doing their jobs than the base mechs or are too gimmicky to be a valuable resource. This pigeon holds the player into a small set of strategies unless they want to increase their chances of unwinnable situations randomly spawning in. Being able to name your own units seems to be a way for the player to make their own fun, but this instance of permadeath alongside only one of your units surviving each reset, which will happen at least one or more times an hour, means that the time taken to name them is better spent breathing.  Not a strategy gem like some claim it to be, especially due to its reliance on random enemy behavior, but could scratch an itch for the right player.;27117;;Randomness sucks out most fun that can be had with the strategy of the game.;;The position-based combat is very fun to learn and experiment with, and when the game manages to propose an actual complicated situation that can be worked through, its incredibly rewarding.;c;37591;206902

2933;;I found this game last night on Xbox Game Pass. Its the first game in the series Ive ever played. Im only six missions in (not sure how many there are, but it still feels like Im at the beginning), and I already really like it. Ive always loved stealth games, and this feels like a real stealth game. Like, I feel like everything I do matters. I also love how its not a game that forces you to run in guns blazing. In fact, it practically discourages it. Your bullets are also your currency. So you can shoot the place up, or you can save your ammo to use on purchasing better stuff. This way, it makes stealth the best option.;50199;;Sometimes, when youre discovered and the enemies start surrounding you, it can get a little disorienting, causing you to die in the confusion;;Great stealth mechanics, you dont have to have played the previous game to understand whats going on;c;37707;207989

2936;I highly recommend Sonic Wings 3 to any person that likes Video games and/or loves Shoot em up games in general.  without further ado: Grab a good friend and save the World!;first of all: Sonic Wings 3 is one of my favorite games from the Shoot em up genre.  The player can choose between 10 different war planes, each has its uniqe weaponary and Special attacks. Some of the charakters retrun from the second game like Hien, Mecha-Keaton, Mao Mao and Cincia & Ellen. There are of course some new faces like Glen, Gill, and Glenda (aka. The Blazers) from the 1991 Arcade game Karate Blazers and some others.  One great thing that i really want to emphasize is the Route Selection system, for it‘s time it was very unique. There is a route selection branch, to choose one route the player has to destroy the left or right wing of the checkered plane. The player starts always in Tokyo (like in SW2) and fights his way trough North Africa, London, France and the Soviet Union to face the Final boss either in Space or Underwater. The great Drum and bass soundtrack creates a unique mood and gives the game a very special touch.  Let‘s talk about the Enemies, Sonic Wings 3 features a lot of Enemies and a ton of Bosses and mid-bosses, there are more than 20 of them waiting to Terminate the player(s) on the end of nearly every stage.  The player has to beat the game twice in order to Finish the game once. The second playtrough is hard in Sonic Wings 2 wars hard but in Sonic Wings 3 it is almost inhuman! It is tougher than its predecessor and might to hard for some gamers, but it has more variation and a lot of replay value.;6775;;;79;Route Selection system a lot of Enemies Drum and bass Soundtrack;Get Ready for another Dogfight!;37603;207292
2937;This game definitely isn’t worth $60 especially after they begin charging a $20 subscription fee for online play. All of the features in this game except online are boring. This game should’ve been priced around the $30 range at most. I don’t regret buying it by any means, but if you’re planning on buying it, make sure you have a good internet connection and wait until it’s on sale.  When it comes to the game as a whole, Ill rate it a 6/10. If I was just rating the online mode, Ill give it a 7/10.;Features: There are a bunch of modes in this game. There is a story mode called Adventure Mode, Tournament Modes, both single player and online, a Swing Mode which is tennis with motion controls, and their Free Play Modes, which can be an online, local, or single player. The game also has two different tennis modes. Simple which is just normal tennis and there is standard which is tennis with the usual Nintendo flair such as special shots, zone shots, trick shots, etc.  Story: On a normal day in the Mushroom Kingdom, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi all become possessed by a tennis racquet. Peach and Daisy head out to save them when Mario and Toad walk in and say “let us do it, you need to stay here and get kidnapped again” and by “us” he means “Mario will do all the work and I will critique your skill when you screw up”. They then head out to get all 6 infinity stones which will make them strong enough to kill um, I mean to defeat the evil tennis racquet.  Presentation: First, let’s talk about the art style. There isn’t much to say here. It’s just a normal Mario Tennis game, so don’t expect anything special  Now let’s talk about the music. Just like a normal Mario game the music is amazing, though the music is pretty extreme for being tennis music *Play music*. Even though the music doesn’t fit in with a tennis game it still gets you into the mood of a MARIO Tennis game. So, for a Mario Tennis game, the music fits and it makes the game really enjoyable.  Gameplay:  Adventure Mode: I had a lot of problems with this mode. My main problem is, its boring and much too easy. The bosses are fun but pose little challenge. I feel like if it was harder it couldve been a lot more enjoyable and it definitely wouldve put your skills more to the test. When playing the bosses, I never had to try more than 3 times which makes it so when you win its like big whoop. When you beat a boss, youre supposed to feel like you just accomplished something. With this game, it doesnt feel like you accomplished anything. Though this all excludes the final boss which Ill talk about now. The final boss was the opposite of the previous bosses. The final boss was challenging, extremely fun, and when I beat it I felt like I accomplished something. Its not the hardest level ever, but it was still difficult enough to be rewarding when I finally beat it. If there is one thing to replay in the story mode, its the final level. Though take that with a grain of salt because I’m no expert at this game so as far as I know, that battle is still extremely easy for the average player  Now that we talked about the bosses, lets talk about the normal levels. The levels were flat-out boring.   There are four different types of levels:  1. There is a normal tennis match 2. There is the type where you rally the ball back and forth between you and a computer until you rally a certain number of times 3. There is a type where you hit the ball against boards to get points  4. The last type is where you rally a ball into all the enemies faces  I disliked all of these modes as they were boring and extremely repetitive. By far my least favorite level was the second to last level. It wasnt difficult, it was just annoying. In the first part of the level, you have to fight Wario and Waluigi. You play as Peach and your partner is Daisy. This part is a piece of cake and I beat it on my first try. In the second part, you play Mario and you fight Luigi. When this part came along I thought it would be a piece of cake... well I was kinda correct. It was easy and it only took me three or four tries, but whenever I died I had to play the whole match over and over again. I also dislike doubles in this game – which I will discuss later in this review – so that made this level even worse.  Now lets talk about some nitpicks I had with this mode. Whenever you died you would have to sit through Toad giving you useless tips, and if he wasnt giving you lousy tips he would be saying things like, Dont give up. You can skip the opening speech bubble after you view it once, but no matter how many times you view the loser speech bubble it will never let you skip it. On top of that, there is no way to avoid it because there isnt a restart button, there is only a quit button. When you press quit you have to listen to toad critique you again, so there is no way to avoid toad Toad’s annoying unskippable pep talk. It’s nearly as annoying as the DS Castlevania games where you had to restart from the home menu every time you died.  Despite all of my complaints, I somewhat enjoyed the story mode. There were a few enjoyable levels and even though I thought the bosses couldve been harder I still enjoyed them. I wouldnt replay the story, though and I definitely wouldnt buy the game just for story mode.  Tournament: The mushroom and flower cup were too easy. They took me less than 8 minutes to win and the ball never came close to passing me. There was no challenge and it was really boring. The Star Cup is harder but still not very fun. I wish there were a couple things more in tournament mode. I wish that there was a tournament mode where you can set a difficulty level and even though I hate doubles (which I’ll get to why in a minute) I still wish there were doubles tournaments.    Online tournament: Now to my favorite part of this game, the online tournament. I fell in love with this mode the first time I played it. I like the simple tournament, but the main mode I play is the standard tournament. The primary reason I like the Online Tournament is because I love playing against actual people instead of computers. Tournament mode makes it even better since you are playing against multiple people and not just one person over and over again. Everyone has a different play style, so whenever you play against a new opponent the match gets mixed up a bit which makes it that much more enjoyable. I enjoy this mode and this is the main mode I play.  Swing Mode: This mode isn’t bad, but it doesn’t work well. There are moments where the game thinks I swung or where it doesn’t realize I swung. There are even moments where my character will have a spasm of 3 to 4 swings when I’m not doing anything. It gets really frustrating when it doesn’t work, but when it does its really fun. I actually like most motion controls, unlike most people. I like the interactive experience and with a tennis game it really fits in. It doesn’t feel like you’re actually swinging a real-life racquet, but its still fun. Though the problem is it rarely works smoothly for the whole round so it can be very frustrating. This is probably my least favorite mode in the entire game because of how inconsistently it works.  Free play: I dont really like any of the single player modes in this game and this is a good example of why. All the AIs are boring to play against. They all have a predictable pattern thats really easy to learn. The doubles mode is even worse though. The AI on my team is always worse than the AI on the Computer’s team. You depend on the AI to help, but it really just hinders you. The AI will be right next to the ball and it forgets to swing. The incompetent computer decision making even occurs when the CPU was set to the pro level. It makes for a frustrating experience and causes me to really dislike doubles. Overall, I didnt really enjoy the single-player free play.  Online free play: The online free play is one of my favorite parts of this game. As I said earlier, I like playing with real people as opponents which makes it a lot harder and more enjoyable since the player won’t just forget to swing his racquet (well usually they wont). Though I do wish you could turn off KO kills on the online mode because it’s annoying when the round gets cut short because of your racquet or the opponent’s racquet. I also wish you could increase the number of racquets per game. It’s at a standstill of 1 racquet, but I would prefer if there was 3. If they changed that then I would love the mode even more. Besides those two critiques, I really love this mode.;81145;;Everything Else;;Multiplayer A couple of the bosses and levels in the story;A ‘Mario Tennis Aces’ Review;36687;208493

There are no choices you can make as a character, there is nothing in the environment you can interact with. This game is very aesthetically pleasing, but as a game it is severely lacking.

2941;Strikers 1945 Plus is a very solid Shoot em up because of its legacy and origin. If you like or love Shoot em ups , then you have to play this game!;The player is back in the Air on the Battlefield of WWII and you have to choose one from 7 Legendary WWII air planes.  P-38 Lightning Vought XF5U Flying Pancake Spitfire Mk. VI Focke-Wulf Ta152 Zero Type 52 Fiat G.56* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden)*  (There are some exclusive* playable aircrafts in this game)  Each of these planes has a Supershot, this individual and unique weapon can save your skin! While the player repeatly pushes the A button a meter on the screens edge will fill up to certain point until a little Bomb flashes, this shows that the Supershot is ready to use. The Supershot is chared by destroying enemies and if the player is holding down the A button and then releasing it the Supershot will be activated.  The game is hard, even on the lowest difficulty settings. The Pink bullets are flying very fast and can be hard to dodge. People without experience will die very often because of this.  After the final boss is destroyed the game starts the 2nd playthrough, but this time it is much harder and the difficulty level goes through the roof in some levels. But a good gamer will master this.  The player is faced with a variety of different enemies like Tank destroyers, Armoured trains, Submarines, Giant Planes and Warships. Nearly all Bosses have something in common, they are hidding a Mech under their hood. If the player reaches a certain amount of damage the hull explodes and a Mech like robot will be reveald. This is the main Boss of the stage.  Strikers 1945 Plus is one of my favorite NEO GEO games and one of the Best on the system. Its always fun and challenging, and thats what I love this game so much!;72911;I would like to mention one thing in advance:  Strikers 1945 Plus is a remix of Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II on a horizontal screen.

2942;;This was a decent game in its own right, but I felt it didnt live up to its predecessor. The dialogue was particularly unnatural at times, which is saying something when compared to LiS which dialogue was already not its strongest suit. The story was compelling, but really lacked that dark, twisty, and semi-supernatural quality the original LiS possessed. I cant decided if I would like more or less if I hadnt played LiS first. Overall, if you played LiS and need more story in that universe, go ahead and give this game a play. Its not very long and will give you insight into some of the characters backgrounds.;29004;;Dialogue was very unnatural. Some parts of the game felt a little buggy.

2943;;Pretty funny and unique game. It started off really strong but after about 1.5 hours of game play it quickly grew repetitive and began to feel a little tedious.

2945;;My favorite in the series and my number one personal favorite game of all time. The Resident Evil series is quite the collective franchise with many great entries, but there is something about Resi4 that captures lightning in a bottle. the gameplay, set layouts and character models have all aged pretty well. This game holds up incredibly well and looks and plays great on the PS4. I love the inventory system and can spend a lot of time organizing my weapons and ammunition. Leon can upgrade his guns to make them more powerful making combat so so satisfying.   The plot is pretty simple and keeps it pretty basic. So if you personally love story driven games keep in mind the story is not really that important.   A Classic and a MUST PLAY!;974;;;;;c;37780;208639
2946;;Fantastic gameplay..Feels like living and breathing batman as portrayed in comics.

2947;;When I saw this in the Xbox Store earlier, I thought it was a joke. I laughed reading the description. But I had to admit, it was definitely an original idea. I went ahead and bought it, figuring if it was bad it was only $5. But luckily, it wasnt a bad game. Its very buggy and the camera keeps jumping around, but it was clearly a cheap game from a small developer, so for what it is its a well-made game.  I played several rounds, and its more intense than youd expect. For starters, there are boxes everywhere, and any one of them could be another player. You have no idea which one is a person unless they move around. Usually theres a ten minute limit, and the first five minutes, no one wants to move. Everyone just looks around and slowly moves. Unfortunately, when you look around the box moves, too. But the last few minutes, it usually delves into chaos, everyone running around trying to kill each other. But its actually kind of funny , seeing a bunch of boxes going at each other with box cutters.  I think my favourite moment while I played was actually a bad moment for me, but it left me impressed. I was chasing a player from room to room, but then I lost sight of them. I walked around and then he killed me. I went back and reviewed the gameplay footage afterwards and they had simply stopped moving. Theyd blended into the other boxes so well that I didnt even notice, and in the heat of the moment I thought they disappeared.  I think this game is good, but also that it could do with a bit of work. The biggest thing being fixing the glitches. Either a patch or a bigger budget sequel. Either way, this game is worth the $5.;23943;;Very buggy Not a whole lot of players;;Original idea Surprisingly intense;c;37707;209073
2948;;This game was enjoyable despite the rough edges. It definitely had issues and was more challenging than I expected, not always in good ways, but it was an interesting story and I wish theyd refine it and put it on PS4.;7233;;Buggy Difficult;;Interesting story Female protagonist;c;37729;209230
2949;;[Doesnt include story spoilers. But maybe details about the gameplay and late-game abilities.]  Being a sequel, and specially since I just replayed the first one in preparation for this, its natural for me to compare them.  In that sense, Guacameele 2 feels like a proper sequel in some aspects, and just like an upgrade on the first one in others.  Visually, the game looks wonderful— the backgrounds of the levels is detailed and always interesting to look at. A few of them are simply beautiful. The dynamic lighting on the foreground is often reflected on the backgrounds, making it all look very flashy and cool.  Some new visual details are appreciated, like enemies having a blur effect when theyre thrown away fast by Juan/Tostada, and enemies leaving a gooie splash of their remains over the surfaces when theyre destroyed— makes it all feel more organic.  I think its a bit of a shame that besides the Eagle Boost, theres no new abilities for Juan/Tostada to enjoy. Just the same special moves from the first one are back, and the new thing about them is that their power can be upgraded.  Finally, I dont think Guacamelee 2 can be considered a Metroidvania  the whole campaign is very linear, and theres not much exploration or discovery. Its more of an action-adventure with a heavy focus on tight platforming and combo-based fighting. I read somewhere that Wrestlevania is more appropriate term for it, and I couldnt agree more. ¡Mucha lucha in this one! And a lot of the platforming actually reminded me a bit of Celeste.  All in all, the charm, mechanics, challenge, humor, easter-eggs/references, and feeling from the original are also here. Its just that theres not enough new stuff to make it feel as fresh as the first one felt.  Still, if you enjoyed the first one, you will definitely have a blast with Guacamelee 2.;75234;;The main enemy roster was simply not as memorable and charming as the one from the original. None of them felt as fleshed-out as the original team of baddies.;;The abilities upgrade system was vastly improved and properly fleshed out.

2953;Mafia III is a fun game, if you dont mind repetitive missions and if you dont consider it a Mafia game.;To be completely honest, I was pleasantly suprised, when I recently finally convinced myself to play this game. After all those bad reviews and complaints by the fans, I expected a terrible game, but it turned out to be a pretty good and enjoyable game. BUT, let me say this. it is a good game, but it is not a good Mafia game.

2954;;As most of indie games, Cat Quest have an amazing artwork, soft and warm colors fill the eye. The sound track completes the environment with and overload of cuteness.   The controls are responsive although the gameplay is repetitive, the dungeons are repetitive and lots of weapons that does not add much to the strategy.  The story is acceptable having this is a light action RPG, but too short, combined with the low difficulty, you can easily beat the game in 8 hours. Yes, I know, after you beat the game you unlock other game modes that provides additional challenge, but the first walk-through, emptied my patience to beat the game a second time. I think that some of this additional modes should be available at the beginning of the game is the form of difficulty option.   If you find it cheap and you enjoy a light RPG, go for it, otherwise, I do not recommend this game.

2958;;I played and beat it a couple months ago. Xbox Store had an E3 sale and I bought several normally expensive games that weekend. This was one of them. Anyway, Ive played Far Cry 3 and 4, and while I enjoyed those, this one is definitely my favourite in the series. One of the best-looking games I have played in a long time, and the controls are easy to learn and use. My only real complaint is that when you reach the end, you cant continue playing. I wont spoil what happens, but I was going to go do the last mission real fast then continue doing the rest of the side quests and collecting things. But you cant do that. I ended up just moving on after the credits rolled. But it felt incomplete in my mind, so Im replaying it. This time Ill do everything BEFORE the final mission.  Something else I loved about it is the AI. You can have up to two companions, including randomly recruited citizens. What really impressed me is that I had a specialist companion and a random citizen companion, and they were bantering back and forth together. They even called each other by name. Ive tried different combination of companions, and its consistent. They must have recorded thousands of lines of just banter, because theyre almost always talking. It does repeat sometimes, but its always interesting to just stop and listen to my companions talk to each other.;28552;;Cant play after end credits, have to restart;;Awesome graphics Easy to learn and use controls Enjoyable companions and conversatons;c;37707;211454
2959;;Every few months or so I give this game another chance. Most recently a couple weeks ago. Dont get me wrong, I can totally see a good game here, and I really want to love this game. But the difficulty is far too high. I cant even get through the first area. Every time you are killed by an orc, they rank up. If you die too much while still a low level, theyll rank up so high that they one hit kill you, and youre usually surrounded by them. I know I just have to get good, which is why I try not to be too hard on this game. As I said, I can see a good game here, I just have trouble with it.;3025;;High difficulty, which gets higher each time you die;;LotR Pretty much everything not in the negative points column;c;37707;211456

This is not your typical hack and slash, there are some unique mechanics that generally improves the formula.  On top of this, you have the surrealistic plot, with the prevalent cheesy parts which contributes the awesomeness.  Butttttt!!! Because there is always a butttt, is this case a big one (pun intended). The camera is BAD, hard to control, lots of time I don’t even know where my character was and got me nauseated.

2961;;Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology was a nice surprise for me in 2018. As someone that personally did not like Octopath Traveler, I felt like I got a lot more of what I was looking for out of an RPG out of this DS remake.  Although the story line is incredibly linear, it tells a fairly interesting story of warring nations against the backdrop of an impending desertification catastrophe. The game does a good job of maintaining a sense of high-intrigue with a cast of NPC characters that have different motivations, that will either ally themselves or oppose you depending upon the situation or timeline. The main cast of party characters, while occasionally tropey, each have moments that are legitimately well written and voice acted, to the point where I did genuinely care about ensuring that each of them had a happy path ending to their storyline.  The plot of this game does a good job of baking itself into the game-play systems as well, specifically via the re-navigation of the games timelines to progress the story-line or solve side quests. I enjoyed the puzzle solving of remembering which part of the history you may need to return to in order to change certain events.   I even enjoyed some of the failure scenarios that can occur when you make decisions at certain critical junctures. Some of them in particular were kind of hilarious, when a seemingly innocuous decision could destroy the world, and they were good for a quick laugh before getting back to the main game without much hassle.   Lastly, regarding the battle system: at the beginning of the game I found it to be somewhat dull. However, once you unlock all of the characters and their abilities, the possibility space of the synergies in battle start to get a lot more interesting. While simple at first, the battle system actually has a fair bit of depth to it, especially when you periodically change your combination of characters. It is incredibly satisfying to game the turn order in order to build up the combo meter and unleash brutally high-damage attacks.   Overall, Radiant Historia was a game that seemed to come out too-late on the DS, and this remake may be coming out too-late on the 3DS as well. I think it is worthy of any RPG fans attention.;27958;;- Somewhat cheap DLC practices - Game requires a bit of an experience grind in the later chapters. - Unclear path on how to get the Perfect Chronology ending;;- Surprisingly deep battle system. - Decent-to-good storyline and characterization, which is baked well into the gameplay;c;36951;211633
2962;Novelty gaming for the first few hours. Has potential but not utilized. The game lacks direction and focus.;We happy few is a game that started out as a genuinely amazing game but quickly the game lost its novelty on me. It is an okay game. It is different but it lacks direction in a word. The main thing that got really boring quite fast was the procedural generation. As it stands right now, our systems or maybe the designers simply lack the capacity to do procedural generation well enough. The issue is that there is not enough variety of models to actually make procedural generation work. On top of that, the procedural generation really doesnt add anything to the game it simply seems gimmicky (like a buzzword). Something the developers used to hype up their game. The story also seems to be heavily focused on mechanical choices however these choices do not appear to have any consequences. A suggestion to future developers if your games are going to have choices make sure it adheres to the butterfly effect. The story is interesting tho although slightly predictable despite having interesting twists and turns.

I finished several times and never get bored of it because I couldnt beat the other game like TMNT or Battle Tank. The game had 6 stages where each stage had its own final boss that you have fight in fighting style. Choujin Sentai Jetman may not popular in NES library but its one decent NES game that you should try with easy game play mechanic.   Players can pick different character (Rangers) that has three type of weapon like sword, punch or gun. Also, each characters have different life bar. Sword and punch are powerful than gun but still its easy to use, players can jump in the simple side-scrolling platformer where all you have to go straight while slay enemies or leave them into the right until you meet level boss where the gameplay will turn into fighting mode which you play as robot fighting against one boss.

I did every side mission I could find. Brilliant game! Now for the furtherment of the story, in the sequel, I propose that the devs not repeat the same formula again with a new Ekon. Rather continue with Jonathan and base the second game around Jonathan perfecting the cure for Elizabeth. Also, expand upon the story of the Red Queen and Myrrin.

Ive been playing these kinds of games lately (like Simons Cat and Idle Heroes), and this is probably the best of the bunch. The graphics are really good for a four year old game (granted, theyve probably been updating it, but still), and the gameplay is very fun. I was originally planning on just going the first five levels, to see how it plays. Ended up going to level fifteen because it is literally that addicting. You regularly unlock new characters and can upgrade them. There are adverts, of course, but not nearly as much as in most of the other mobile games I have played. Pretty much my only complaint is that it holds your hand for too long. I understand stopping gameplay to explain the rules for the first few levels, but it was still doing it at level ten. But other than that, I dont really have any complaints. This is a well designed game that I would recommend to anyone.;59922;;Holds your hand too long;;Fun gameplay Great graphics Addicting;c;37707;214730
2991;;Need for Speed: PayBack was on ok game as a standalone. However, if seen in the context of the previous instalments, it does not hold a candle to them. This game cut a lot of corners when it came to animations i.e. cutscenes. Choosing to simply have two cars stand next to each other and have the voice actors speak. Payback had so much potential but the purposeful cuts in the cutscenes really held them back. On top of that, the devs decision to remove the classical garages where you could upgrade your car for loot boxes was a terrible idea. However, I did like the addition of a different type of cars instead of having only one car which can do everything. But the loot boxes and speed cards really just took a lot away from the game. I know there is going to be a sequel please improve upon your mistakes.;36662;;Lootboxes Speed Cards No Upgrade Garages Soundtrack;;Story;c;283;214803
2992;;With so many options for making your way through the story, this has to be one of the more open ended RE experiences, which was awesome to make my way through.  Looked better than RE2 and was certainly more difficult- no cake walk here.  Will say I got WAAAAY overpowered by the end of it, but I had a pretty great time getting through the extra challenge of many more zombies and the unrelenting Nemesis chasing me everywhere- pretty tense.  Only thing Id knock it down for was the story- just wasnt very deep- BUT did have pretty good pacing.  Fun stuff.

2993;;A fan of Hokuto no Ken since 1988, I am pleased to report that this is indeed the best Hokuto no Ken game ever made.  I imported it from Japan earlier this year, played it through and even completed the 60+ side stories. Think of it as some kind of Grand Theft Auto in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where you play as Kenshiro and decimate legions of punks. Sure it doesnt have the budget or the polish of Grand Theft Auto, but this is as close as were going to get for such a niche franchise. The visuals are really nice inside the city, the side stories are interesting and fun, the fighting is incredible, even the music rocks - especially the remix of Receive You which had me headbanging every time. If youre a fan of Hokuto no Ken or any violent, over-the-top martial art anime, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Expect awesome bloody fights, appreciate the distractions, but do not expect amazing story-telling. The format is from Yakuza, but story is not the focus here.;55112;;- My only complaint about the game is that there should have been more settlements and stories outside of the main city hub. I know its a desert but its just... too deserted. There are lots of places and corners that are just devoid of anything.  - Lots of back and forth in the desert, even with the use of fast travel points.;;- Pretty good alternate storyline, although the main antagonist was not very impressive. - Side activities are fun, and their little stories are quite interesting. - The fighting is orgasmic. Unleashing Hokuto Shinken upon the various thugs and enemies has never been so satisfying. Combat can be a bit rough at first but hang on, once upgrades have been unlocked you will soon feel like an unstoppable god of death. - Torrents of blood and gore for everyone ! - Reproduces really well the ambience of the manga and anime. - Driving the buggy in the dunes of rocks and sands is more fun than people make it out to be, especially once its upgraded. - The epic remake of Receive You. - Stay until the credits have ended for a surprise :);c;11602;214842

2996;;Throughout the years, Santa Monica Studios has improved with their technology but fell behind in narrative. That was set to change with the new title in the ‘God of War’ series  simply titled ‘God of War’. With this new entry, Cory Barlog and his team set out to reinvent the franchise by focusing on a new style of gameplay and a larger focus on narrative. After completing the game one-hundred percent, I can safely say that ‘God of War’ is a technical and narrative success in almost every regard. Sure, it had its issues, but in the grand scheme of things this game accomplished everything that it set out to do.  We once again play as Kratos as he takes his son to the highest point in all the realms to spread his mother’s ashes. It was a basic plot with not many twists or turns. However, the way it was executed was well done to say the least. The whole game was one continuous shot, always keeping you with Kratos and his son Atreus. Since the camera never cut, pacing was a key element to making this technique not feel like a hindrance. Luckily the game was pretty much perfectly paced. The story progressed in such a natural way, it never felt like it stopped or halted. Dialogue and characters were also key to making a story like this successful. This was where the game faltered a bit. Don’t get me wrong, the dialogue wasn’t bad, but sometimes characters repeated things that we had seen visually. Overall, however, the dialogue was pretty good and kept my engagement level high. Character wise the game was limited. You have Kratos of course who felt more like a fleshed-out person. He goes through a personal journey in this game, but not one of revenge or anger. But a journey of bondage and knowledge. A journey that would improve not just himself as a father, but help his son become a warrior. Atreus seemed reminiscent of Kratos’ old personality. He used anger to defeat his enemies, but he never knew how to control it making him go off the rails a few times. These two characters learned off each other in such an organic and fun way. In fact, there was quite a bit of humorous banter between them. This was elevated by the great side characters such as Mimir, who was also quite funny. But this humor never felt out of place or forced, which help kept the tone consistent from scenario to scenario. What also elevated these characters and narrative was the gorgeous visuals and performances. Some of the best this generation. In general, the game felt very fluid in pacing and tone, effectively giving us a great narrative. However, although narrative is important, it’s up to gameplay to make or break a game.   Previous games in the series revolved around hack-and-slash gameplay with a fixed camera angle. With ‘God of War (2018)’ Santa Monica decided to go a with a more traditional over-the-shoulder camera angle, and a more nuanced combat system. Gone are the linear levels, as exploration is now a key element. The central hub in the game was pretty expansive with plenty of small islands and caves to delve into. These areas usually contained useful components to upgrade your gear, and plenty of treasures to sell for currency. Along with these areas came side quests. The side content never felt as engaging as the main narrative, but they were a good enough distraction for me to go through them. Plus, you were also given useful items, such as new armor to upgrade. But these areas and side quests also contained plenty of combat challenges and encounters, but these encounters wouldn’t be fun if the combat was bad. So, how is the combat? Excellent in my opinion.  Although the game presented us with a limited arsenal of weapons, what we were given was still fantastic. The ‘Leviathan Axe’ is the Nordic weapon that Kratos possesses, and it was extremely satisfying to use. The first time I threw the axe and called it back was one of the highlights of the game for sure. It was surprising how this single weapon never got repetitive to use. It helped that you could choose different special attacks in the ‘Rune’ system. Each ‘Rune’ had a special attack like stated, making combat more varied. You could also customize your axe’s handle to change some of the stats for it. Back to combat, it’s probably some of the most visceral and epic combat this generation has gotten. Every blow with your axe felt brutal and oh so satisfying. Plus, the enemies you do encounter had great AI. I was constantly challenged at every combat situation, never making the game boring or dull. Sadly, the enemies you fight, although nicely designed, did get over used. What I mean by that was that there wasn’t much variety in the enemy types. On many occasions the mini boss was just an elemental creature, a troll, or a giant. The smaller enemies had the same problem which was a shame. This didn’t detract from the game that much, but it was an issue I thought I’d address. Other than that, the game-play loop and systems were addictive to say the least.   As a whole package, ‘God of War (2018)’ is defiantly up there for best game this generation. It was visceral, engaging, and most of all  fun to play. I commend the folks at Santa Monica Studio for not only maturing, but for taking a risk that could have ended horribly without the dedication and talent they have. I hope we get more AAA, story-driven, blockbuster games like this one. As this game has shown, once again, that story-driven games are most certainly not dead.;19560;;;;;c;38638;216909

3002;;Being a First Wave Founder of the game, i saw development closely, and of course, due to the NDA contract, i didnt spill a drop of it~  Ive been an Insider and Tester for almost 4 years now, and i saw elements come and go, characters change, and engine tinkered, But i can safely say that... they did all the right choices!  Im not one for Reviews, but Ill try my best:  About the game itself, its a Space Opera Game  The game name is true to its roots, it is, in essence, a Star Control game (the Origins part of it is explained in the game itself) its a Star Control game, and SO Much more! It takes a similar approach to Alien Conversation, Ship Battles, Space Exploration and such, And improves on it!   The Conversation part has a lot of options and moral choices, when you say and do certain things, you can visibly see the reaction on the aliens face (or whatever body they have, some are very weird!) some aliens also have alternate versions of themselves due to being different individuals, and thats neat! while meeting new aliens ships, You COULD go guns ablazin  you could also hail them and talk to them... cant promise all of the aliens of our galaxy are willing to listen though.  The Ship Battles are very addicting... if you got a right group combination, there are MANY ships to look from, and of course, not all of them will be right for you, but you can test them out quickly by filling ship slots and going on a non-ranking battle against A.Is, the Battlefields can be vast and full of different hazards, some have 1 to 3 planets on it, some have energy leech nebulas that drain your ship of energy, asteroids can give you an edge against other players or crush your play. the battlefield is also littered with Pick-ups, some give shield, some energy, crew, speed and etc.  The Space Exploration is the core of the game i would say, after you get hyperspace-borne you are free to roam and explore our sector of space! the map is GIGANTIC, and for added awesomeness, its an accurate representation of our galaxy stars, with names and distances being the most realistic without destroying gameplay, but beware, your ship begins very underprepared, you dont have enough fuel to go EVERYWHERE, while you CAN go in every direction, you would be wise to calculate on where you can go, get some resources to sell on Space Bases and buy parts to upgrade your ship, but lets say you have a fully upgraded ship, it does not matter where in the story you are, no place is restricted, so even with the ship limitations, you have a sense of freedom in the cold reaches of the galaxy!  The Planet Exploration is an incredibly addicting part of the game, you go to a planet with your ship and search for a landing zone, have found the zone, you launch a Lander on the planet, and after a stability minigame (that can be made easier with ship upgrades) you land on the planet, now you have the freedom to roam around it, collecting floating resources! resources change depending on the planet type, like Acid planets have acidic elements and so on, but on some kinds of planets like the Acid planets, there are the ambient hazard, planets that can melt, freeze or blow up your lander. again, you can escape danger with ship upgrades, but there are also upgrades that help exploration, such as boosters, jump-modules and of course, GUNS! for what? Not all Aliens of our galaxy are sentient, some are just animals as we have here on Earth, and some are More akin to the Extinct Dinosaurs, some are also Gentle Giants and some are not even Organic, but protectors of old Facilities, and thats another thing you can find on a planet: Cities, Crashed Ships, Caves, Machines and even some Unidentified Objects.  The Soundtrack is Futuristic and Mechanic when it needs to be, Organic and Tribal or even Dangerous or Happy! either way, its also helpful, each alien race has its own theme, and if you are in their territory or near a base, their respective theme will play in a slow and forboding remix or happy and safe tune~  The Voice Acting is one of my favorite parts of the game! its very different between races, giving each a personality, and you can already tell the personality with the first line out of their mouths (the ones that have em) it does make me want to talk more to the majority of characters, to hear their voices and responses, also there is a hand log that shows what the character said if you want to skip, or you did on accident, clicking on said phrase on the log, makes the character talk again! handy~  The Builder is another core element of Origins, the ability to Build Ships, Structures, Planets, and even Universes! the goal of the game aside from its main Origins-Universe, is giving the player the ability to make its own story with these tools, an ambitious idea that im hopeful it will pay out! with these tools, you can not only make your own universe, but making existing ones like Star Wars or Mass Effect! its hard work, but its possible!   I think this is what i have to say for Star Control:Origins so far! Of course, i missed a lot of elements, lets say i want them to be a surprise, yeah, thats it. I expect much more in the future, not only as Free Updates and DLC, but as a growing community that can share Ships, Buildings and what finds they found on the game, because believe me, the game is HUGE! There IS a Main Story but its not the only one, there are SO MANY MORE, that it makes you take the Main one aside for moments, thats awesome! really hope this does well, the development got too much-underserved fire from haters because its not the old Star Control, but i say, this is the PERFECT reboot for the Series!   10/10;25311;;;;;c;38838;217781

3004;;The story is pretty great and full of interesting and bold themes and impressive twists and plot developments. Also the ending, though I found it to be too uplifting at first, is just the right amount of sweet-bittersweet when you think about it. However the writing is spotty and a bit inconsistent, while the games game nature is still in question in my mind. The small bits of interactivity are clearly shoe-horned in and the game only takes advantage of exploratory storytelling in a couple of instances. The fact that theyre making it into an animated film says a lot, though Ill still be looking forward to it since this shouldve been an animated film to begin with IMO. Overall the lack of interactivity and the clear option of a different medium to better convey its story took away from my experience with it, but its worth playing nonetheless  a great story presented as a decent experience that falls just short of the storys high standard.;5025;;;;;c;8741;217924

The ability to move around while shooting is great, the graphics were impressive, the voice acting was even pretty stellar at times.  The story got pretty convoluted at times (especially in the case of Adas scenario where she just SHOWS UP to the next area with no real explanation), but overall I found it satisfying to see all the stories weave in and out of each other.  Not the best RE game, but Im sure there are worse.

3014;;I had a lot of fun with this game. The world was massive and stunning and there were many parts where I got on such a roll and was absolutley loving the gameplay and just having a blast. The story itself was thrilling and I absolutely loved uncovering the secrets of Alrest, and discovering all the dense lore that monolith created. My main issue is that there were many moments in the game where poor design resulted in me as the player feeling unfairly stuck or halted from moving forward such as when certain field skills were required to move forward even though the game hadn’t informed the player it would be required or forcing the player to retread certain areas such as a long hallway over and over again when trying to refight a boss. It’s these things that really pulled me out of the game and made me lose motivation to play. I’m glad to story kept me hooked because if it hadn’t there were definitely a few of these moments that brought me close to giving up.

3020;;Ive been playing this game since around midnight when it was officially released. Although I wanted to do a 24 hours in review, I cant wait another two and a half hours to gush about this game!  When Origins came out a year ago, it was immediately my favourite Assassins Creed game. Prior to that, Black Flag was the one I preferred. Well, Odyssey did the impossible and beat out Origins. I was expecting it to be good at the very least, but I was sure all the extreme praise was just overhyping the game. Ive heard everyone talking about how every action you do has consequences and how your involvement in the world really matters. Yeah, Ive heard that before. Heck, Life is Strange has a message at the start of the game that says something to that effect. But really it only means certain things you do at specific times matter, and you always know when that is. Oh, this is one of Those Moments. Better decide carefully.  Not with Odyssey. Every choice you make, big or small, effects the world around you. Thats not exaggeration. This game might even be more replayable than Skyrim, in terms of outcomes. At least, thats my opinion as of writing this, having played the game less than 24 hours. Im already planning on playing it again once Ive completed it and done everything I can, only so I can go through and make different choices.  Speaking of Skyrim, in that game you can choose which faction you want to join, and youre stuck with that choice the rest of your playthrough. I thought thatd be the case in this game when I heard youd be able choose to join the Spartans or the Athenians. Well, turns out you can play both sides. Youre a mercenary! Personally, I want to join the Athenians, but I dont want the Spartans to hate me because I MEAN HAVE YOU SEEN 300?!?! So Im making them think I am helping them, while letting their enemies escape. So it actually feels like Im a double agent. And its not what Ubisoft intended the story to be. I CHOSE to do that, and the game let me. When they said you control your destiny, they really meant it.  Sailing is back! And it feels like it did in Black Flag! Granted, a little less technologically advanced because its Ancient Greece, but that was the easiest part for me to jump into.  This map is huge! seriously, Kephallonia (the Siwa of this title) is large enough that I actually thought that was the main area. Once I set out to see, I found out that I was very wrong, I could see the map, but it wasnt until I set sail that I realise I could zoom out, and when I did my jaw dropped. I cannot wait to explore all of it!  The game also looks better than Origins does, as youd expect with it being newer and all. Ive already taken several awesome photos with the photo mode. Wish I could post them here, but by the time I thought of it the screenshots had already been maxed out.  Theres a new optional system here you can choose to use at the beginning. You can either use the traditional guided system where you get a quest and it tells you where it is, or you can use the new exploration system, where you use dialogue clues to figure out where the objective location is. That probably sounds awful, and I thought so at first, but once you use it youll see it actually adds to the immersion. Like, when someone gives you a quest, you can ask them where to find the bandit leader (for example), and theyll say something like, Im not sure, but I hear hes east of the statue of Zeus. You pull up the map and see a ? to the east of where the statue of Zeus is and head there. Or maybe youve already discovered the bandit camp and it shows theres a bandit camp to the east of the statue. (this was just an example. I dont think theres a bandit camp to the east of the statue).  I do have a few complaints, though theyre not very big. In fact, one of the biggest complaints just happens to be with the directions given. Sometimes theyll say something like, Its to the east of the coast of Greek-name-I-forgot, and I look and its actually to the west of that coast. It does throw me off occasionally, but it doesnt happen often enough that its that big of an issue.  Some of the new mechanics are a little confusing at first, but Im sure with use itll become second nature. Like, the ability skills are LT+A, B, Y, and X, or LB+A, B, Y, and X. You can map the ability skills to whichever one you want, and in the heat of a fight its confusing and I keep pressing the wrong buttons. But again, new mechanic Ive only used for less than 24 hours. If I update this review in a couple months Ill probably be laughing that I was struggling so much with it. Skyrims controls baffled me at first, and I ended up trying to jump with Y in other games for awhile.  All in all, I think this game is definitely worth a buy.

3024;;I wanted No Man’s Sky to be an intriguing journey of exploration in a vast universe. Sadly, there’s just not enough substance in the game to pull off that fantasy and it ends up being a disappointingly shallow and hollow experience.

Visiting the first planets is genuinely thrilling and ticks all the boxes for a great adventure. However, the excitement quickly fades off after the first few planets as you start to realize that you’ve experienced most of what the game has to offer.;3225;Normal playthrough.

3030;;Kind of a mixed bag of feelings about this- I love the GOW series but this entry felt kind of… not as good.  Felt like a lot of the assets from GOW III were reused, felt like the story was not quite as polished, also like the pacing especially at the beginning was REALLY slow.  Granted, it also had stellar production otherwise so theres no complaints there.  Sometimes too easy and was able to plow through it with zero problems, and at rare occasions get stuck under an unnecessary difficulty spike.  Just uneven across the board, but still better than most games out there.

3034;;Based on the PS3 Version  God of War- this game is beyond EPIC  it defines the word.  Everything from the story, to the pacing, to the combat, puzzles, environments, sound design and voice acting (for the most part) is so pitch perfect and so tightly constructed.  Very few games have this much going for it, but this one does.  In terms of Action Platformers with Hack and Slash elements, this is the BEST possible outcome.

Had interesting and varied puzzles, combat seemed slicker in some ways, definitely more polish throughout.  Just something about the narrative seemed very convenient for the events to happen, like it NEEDED this to occur to get to the finale in the third one.  Pretty solid overall though.

3035;;The latest in the popular Call of Duty series has arrived with Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII.  The game has made the controversial decision to forgo the traditional campaign in favor of a Battle Royale mode known as Blackout and a more expansive online experience which includes more Zombie modes and a greater emphasis on gameplay.  I played the game first at E3 and then again during the Beta phases for the game so I had a decent familiarity with what to expect when the full release version of the game arrived.  After several days of playing the game, I have to say it is to me a mixed bag and many aspects of it disappointed me which is very frustrating as fan of the series since the very first game.  The look and feel of the game does not come across to me as a new game but instead to me look and play like DLC for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Many of the maps seem familiar and have been updated from their appearances in previous games.   The same holds true for the weapons and kill streaks. I am not saying it is not fun, but it all has a sense of having seen most of it before.  Another very annoying change to the game is the severe limitation of grenades in the game. Usually a player has a grenade option which comes in handy when Snipers setup behind cover. Without the ability to lob a grenade to get Snipers out from cover, players are easy pickings, especially when the first appear on the screen. You can unload a full clip into a player at a distance and still end up dead with one shot from a sniper. As such you have to wait until you reach level 42 in order to add them to your customized loadout and even then they are very Nerfed from what players have come to expect.  The multiplayer modes are what you have come to expect as there are the Team Deathmatch variations as well as the Capture and Control modes and a new mode called Heist where players need to capture or prevent the capture of a target.  For me the most enjoyable aspect of the game was the Zombie modes as not only were the players I was matched with usually very helpful, but they were also much friendlier than many of the other people I encountered.  The Blackout mode is very popular with gamers but not being a fan of the One and Done mode of play, I found myself enjoying the vast details of the map and preferring to work with a team, capturing vehicles, and such. I have seen multiple players unload point blank on a player in this mode only to see them walk away and one shot kill their attackers. This is either a hack or an example of how imbalanced things can be at times and you will see multiple instances of players taking numerous hits and walking away while others go down with one shot.  Black Ops IIII does not have a regenerative health system and instead requires players to use a timed injection in order to restore health.  This is all designed to foster teamwork and to make the game more appealing to the eSports community. While this is nice, it deviates from much of what has made the game so appealing from the start.  The game to me seems like it was hurried to market as it released on October 12th vs the traditional November release date. I am sure a big part of this was a desire to beat Red Dead Redemption 2 to market but in doing so it seems that things are missing from the final product. There is much to like about the game as it is still an exciting and intense experience but to me is the first Call of Duty game to not feel shiny and new but instead more of the same in many cases. The developers have supported the game with numerous updates and there are more on the way as well as planned DLC down the road so the game as it is now is likely to change in the next few months as more feedback is given to developers and new features are added.  Hopefully they will also look to add a campaign at a later date as although it is fun, it seems lacking and dated in many aspects as the changes seem like a step back to me rather than progress. 4 stars out of 5;83727;;Seems more like DLC than a new game, balance issues, no campaign.;;Variety and lots of action.;c;33562;224028
3036;;There is a lot to the game, at least in its current version Alpha 16 with Alpha 17 on the horizon for release, with major visual and game-play advancements and changes.  In short, the game by itself can be a lot of fun, offers something for everyone, from shooting to allowing to unleash your creativity building almost anything you can imagine. The games community is generally very helpful also, with many servers (some very active and others not at all) to play on, in both PvE and PvP modes. There are also quite a few mods available for the game, mostly used when playing on a server, breathing fresh air into the game, while waiting for the next major update - which are rather rare, only once to twice a year. The game can be experienced mainly bug-free, with minor versions after a major version update usually being released fairly quickly, to fix mostly major and some minor issues.  In more detail (tl dr):  The game is best enjoyed in multiplayer mode, to start off, it is suggested to go the PvE route, so not to have to worry about other players attacking and killing you, yet in some cases this does not prevent from stealing or destruction of your stored and built belongings / property - it is highly recommended that you join an active server, which is known to have active admins on it, which there are quite a few.  Overall, the fun to frustration ratio is very high, being on the fun side of things, with only very occasional bugs to be found, and those not being game-breaking.  The best part of the game is that everything can be built and also destroyed, from landscape to trees to skyscrapers and everything in-between. Unlike the game Minecraft however, 7 Days to Die does so without looking blocky, plus it has quite believable physics, making trees fall, structures and landscapes collapse / cave in, damaging other blocks, objects, and even killing NPCs (wildlife, zombies) and players in the process.  The crafting system is, also quite simplified (at least compared to Alpha 11 and before of the game), quite extensive and fun, allowing even to assemble modern ranged weapons and tools via their individual parts.  In terms of transportation, there is only one motorized object, the minibike, but that is to change in Alpha 17 drastically, which introduces quite a range of motorized new vehicles, some of those being multi-seaters, ranging from motor bikes to gyrocopter (which might be only a single-seater), plus a non-motorized bike / bicycle.  Traversing the landscape on foot, however, is not as bad as it might sound, especially later on when having upgraded the characters stamina, allowing to run for extended duration and recovering quite rapidly afterwards. When playing multiplayer, many game servers offer also the method of teleporting to various locations on the map.  On the server side of things, the Windows version has to be restarted multiple times a day, if running on Linux this is not necessary but data corruption can occur eventually.;5574;;Major updates rare, usually 1 to 2 per year only.

3037;Sure the game isnt the most original on the market, but just the simple fact that you play as Spider-Man made almost all the content enjoyable. Probably my favorite superhero game.;The wait for a great Spider-Man game had seemed infinite. Many games have come out from Activision revolving around the web-slinger for years now. But none of them reached that level of polish and fluidity that many people want out of a Spider-Man game. Treyarchs Spider-Man 2 was the closest we got to the ideal web-slinging experience. Many years later of crappy games about the hero, Sony regained the rights and gave the reigns to Insomniac games. The studio behind Sunset Overdrive and Ratchet &amp  Clank revealed their new depiction of the hero simply titled Spider-Man. Two years later the game came out to critical acclaim across the board, and for good reason. This was not only the definitive Spider-Man experience but the best superhero-based game that Ive ever played.  Of course, one of the main ingredients of a Spider-Man game is the web-swinging. Fortunately, Insomniac understood that it had to be fluid and responsive, so thats exactly what we got. Just swinging around the city was some of the most fun Ive ever had in a game. It helped that momentum was also a goal that the team had. Rarely did I ever just get stuck on a surface or ledge. This was by far the best aspect of the game, but thats not where the studio just stopped and called it a day at. Many other aspects of the game felt just as polished as the web-swinging. Take combat for instance. Comparing this games combat system to others like it I can definitely say that this is the best of its kind. Just like the web-swinging, the combat here was so fast-paced yet fluid. Stringing combos together always felt satisfying, mostly because it wasnt easy. Dont get me wrong, the controls were solid and easy to learn, but the combat itself was difficult to master. This was elevated by the great AI that would often attack in groups. Sure, they screwed from time to time but as a whole, they gave me a decent challenge most of the time. Of course, there were many other systems that fed into combat, such as gadgets to upgrade, suits to collect with special abilities and leveling up to gain points to gain further combat moves. All these systems came together to create a game that constantly rewarded you. But whats the point of all these systems if there isnt anything to use them on.  Most open-world games suffer from busy-work and dull side activities. As for Spider-Man, Id say the game was guilty of such activities. However, youre Spider-Man. This fact alone automatically made these usually boring side activities into exhilarating and addictive tasks. You have your typical towers to hack in order to reveal more of the city, collectibles, etc. Except here towers were quickly dealt with due to Spider-Mans agility, and collectibles consisted of learning more about this universe. In turn, I felt the incentive to activate these towers to uncover these interesting and charming collectibles. However, these werent the only side activities. Harry Osbourn left a decent amount of these Research Stations in order to help improve the city from an environmental standpoint. These stations presented an array of fun and interesting agility challenges. Add in Taskmaster who tasks you to partake in fun combat scenario challenges to gain meddles, side missions that take you through fun mini-stories, and challenging crimes and bases to take-down. The only side activity Id say was boring was Black Cats. Her missions tasked you with finding cameras around the city to take a picture of a cat with at different locations. These set of missions never captivated me, but at least it provided with a nice looking suit.   Game-play will always be the key to making a game good, but the narrative will also always be important for games who decide to focus on one. In my opinion, the story presented here was fantastic. My only issues with it had to do with a few of the weak stealth missions with Mary Jane and Miles, and the underdevelopment of Mr. Negative. Other than that I thought narratively speaking this game succeeded with flying colors. First, I thought the use of cheesy humor and dialogue worked fairly well for when it was appropriate. It added to the charm and wit of Peter Parker. Speaking of which, I thought this portrayal of Peter Parker was one of the best weve gotten in mainstream media. Not only was he well voice acted, but he was interesting and made mistakes. And ultimately the end of his story was impactful, to say the least. Supporting characters such as Mary Jane, Aunt May, and Miles Morales were all welcome additions adding more of an emotional anchor to Peter. But what about the rogues gallery? Id say it was pretty solid. Nothing crazy or too surprising from what we already knew, but there was one villain who was not exactly surprising but welcomed. Not going to spoil who it was, but let me just say that this character had solid motivations and partook in one of the best and most impactful cutscenes in the game. As a package, the narrative in Spider-Man was tightly presented and will be remembered as one of the best game narratives of 2018 in my eyes.  Although Spider-Man didnt blow me away from an originality standpoint, it managed to capture the very best of Spider-Man and polish its features to a tee. Never was I bored or felt anything repetitive. I lost myself within this world for hours upon hours, and I dont regret one bit of it.;19565;Hey, it time for new review guy, I hope it is to your liking.;Weak stealth Side content, although mostly fun, did have some weak missions and was ultimately kind of generic.

3038;;Year after year, Ubisoft had consistently turned out an Assassins Creed game. Obviously, this led to the franchise feeling stale, so the company put the game on a year break and made a comeback with 2017s Assassins Creed Origins. In many ways, that new entry differentiated itself from the previous entries, adding new RPG mechanics that were appreciated but ultimately werent enough. Enter Assassins Creed Odyssey, the game that took those mechanics and fleshed them out more. Add in a decent narrative and a more focused RPG system and we have ourselves a solid game...mostly. Although this game was solid, issues from previous entries and shady business practices held it back from being something great.  What most Ubisoft open-world games suffer from is repetitiveness and a lack of variety. However, the Assassins Creed franchise was always the biggest culprit of this. Luckily, Odyssey put a larger focus on multi-layered side-quests, open-world exploration, and combat. As for the side-quests, although not brilliantly written, most of them brought upon semi-interesting stories with fun objectives and worth-while rewards in terms of weaponry. As for the other reward, XP, I found it to be lacking in the amount that was given. It always took a lot of XP to level up, and it was important for using new weapons and fighting certain enemies. But the quests never rewarded much, artificially adding play time. As I said, I enjoyed most of the side-quests, but there were also some quests that werent enjoyable but provided with a lot more XP. And even then, it wasnt enough to get me to further levels at a reasonable rate. Like I mentioned before, I enjoyed the side-quests, but for people who dont enjoy them, I found it a cheap way to squeeze money out of them with XP boosts.  The one element that I had more consistent fun with was the open-world exploration and combat. From a purely visual standpoint, the game was absolutely beautiful drawing me to explore and see the gorgeous vistas and landscapes. However, it wasnt all flash and no substance. The lands of Ancient Greece were home to many caves, cities, shipwrecks, and military bases. All of which contained valuable loot and weapons that could be sold or used to aid you in combat. Military bases usually contained the most useful items, more specifically weapons. But, obtaining these items usually meant you had to engage in stealth or combat. The stealth system here felt much more fluid as animations were seamless for quick kills. However, getting caught meant combat was about to break out. Combat, here, was genuinely fun, mostly due to the upgrade system. Using skill-points you can unlock special moves such as the Spartan Kick, which is self-explanatory. These special moves added a more strategic approach since you had to conserve your energy bar to execute a single move. As for the regular sword to sword combat, I found it to be decent. Nothing great, but a solid combat system that did feel a bit clunky from time to time.  Combat was not the only thing that was affected by clunkiness. Odyssey chose to put a larger focus on a multi-pathed narrative. This new choose your path narrative element was a welcomed addition, but one that came with some clunky story beats. A couple of times the plot tried to focus on too many things. One moment youre dealing with a cult and the next your fighting a war with Sparta. I found that aspect to be the most jarring, however, as a whole I found the story-line this time around to be much more interesting and less formulaic than the previous games. Id say the biggest thing holding it back was the dialogue, but it didnt drag it that much. I was happy that the game didnt follow the basic revenge plot that almost every Assassins Creed game followed. This time it was more complicated and open-ended which had a lot to do with the dialogue tree system. What was surprising, though, was how the dialogue options actually affected the story. Some of the time there was no drastic change, but when it came to certain decisions, they had quite a bit of effect on the over-arching narrative. That was the biggest pleasant surprise, and it really helped make the story less linear, which effectively made it more interesting for me.   Ive never been a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise before this one. But after Origins I found the series had potential to make a comeback. Although I wouldnt call this game amazing it had the potential to be. The foundation is clearly here, I just wished Ubisoft would have let this game breath instead of forcing XP grinding as a ploy to sell microtransactions. In the future I hope this team of developers get to make their game, because they have the potential to make Assassins Creed game of the year material.;103054;;;;;c;38638;223035

3041;;Played on EU GC version. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai is a 2D fighting based on the anime of the same name.  The story mode follows along the anime with the most important parts of the show up to the Cell saga. The cutscenes are pretty well animated and has held up somewhat, although the AIs difficulty spikes feels random sometimes, making it feel unnecessarily unfair. The fighting system is not very deep, and will feel shallow in comparison to other fighting games that has a more elaborate system.  The skillshop and Capsule system is a welcoming interesting feature, making up for the shallow combat. But the game ends up making you grind like a chore for every one of them if you intend to complete it with all the exclusive capsules obtained via the dragon balls. Overall the game is worth playing through for any Dragon Ball Z fan.;2563;;- Collecting Capsules becomes a sloggy grind if you want to 100% the game. - Legend of Satan is just a survival highscore mode. - The AI has rampant difficulty spikes. - Some skills are a too effective/ineffective.;;- Story mode albeit short, feels true to the anime. - Soundtrack is all around great. - Interesting Capsule system.;c;39973;224488
3042;;Right, so Ive played Red Dead Redemption 2 for a bit more, so I can really talk about what I really think about it. Yesterday I posted that I didnt like it too much because the beginning was too slow and drawn out. But shortly after, I made it past that part to the open world, the main game, and the game definitely improves once it opens up. It is a little intimidating because you have to keep an eye on everything, like youre playing Sims. Id rather just play the game and run around doing things, but I have to keep an eye on if Im hungry, if my horse is happy, and other things. If you dont eat or sleep often youll lose stamina and wont be able to run or do most basic things. Which is kind of a cool concept of an idea, but kind of annoying in practice. Everyone says that they want more and more realistic games, but if they made a 100% realistic game, itd be the most boring game ever made.  But I dont want to just sit here and complain about the game. There are things I really do like. The stealth is really cool. You will sometimes have your gang with you, and you can sync shot like in Wildlands, so you can take out multiple targets through silent ranged at the same time. Ill almost always choose stealth when its offered, and I love the stealth here. I also like the Eagle Vision. Thats what they actually call it! Ubisoft should sue! lol But seriously, its very helpful and Im glad they added it to the game.  One feature I was confused about when they announced it was the hair growth. For some reason, it was difficult for me to fathom real time hair growth in a game. Im used to picking a hair style in games and it staying that way until I change it. But in RDR2, Arthurs hair and facial hair will grow if you dont get it trimmed. And unlike past R* games (which I know is always on lists of complaints of their games), you cant go to the barber and have them give you any style on the list, including longer. You can only make it shorter. Its actually oddly realistic.  Theres a ton more I could talk about, but Ive covered the main parts. This game is much better than I was thinking yesterday. I give it a seven out of ten.;25076;;Opening dragged on for too long Sims-like character maintenence;;Fun stealth Awesome graphics Cool hair growth;c;37707;224638
3043;;A fitting end to the original series, even though the very end of it was kind of contrived.  And with upgraded graphics this game looks absolutely amazing!  Has really good pacing and combat, and is fairly easy in comparison to some of the other entries in the series which is a breath of fresh air.  Funny to think this was how it ended, not knowing another game was coming six years later.  Great game regardless.

3046;;A creepy game with IMHO absolutely HORRIFIC looking graphics, even for the time it came out.  It leaned a lot on sound design and music to create a believable atmosphere, and legitimately clever puzzles to make things interesting.  But, GOOD GOD, the voice acting was RE1 level bad.  And most of the story is nearly incomprehensible, though it moves at a relatively decent pace.  Overall, an odd, quirky, macabre game that isnt really as polished or fleshed out as some people like to remember it.  Decent at best honestly.

3047;;A beautiful game by Treasure! That is if you have the Saturn original. Unfortunately, most have either through the Playstation store or on the Playstation, both of which lack the second video display processor that helps with scaling and background animations. Due to that the scaling is wonky on all playstation ports. Working Designs really messed up the American release by somehow increasing the difficulty and removing sprites of the bunny smoking (probably to keep a low rating), but the game was difficult enough as it was and definitely did NOT require more hits to each enemy and so on.   What I love about this is the quirkiness of each character and how Shyna keeps trying to correct each enemy she faces saying she is the Messenger of Justice, but this also poses a problem as the characters are quirky for the sake of being quirky...   The sound design is about equal, however, the Saturn for some reason has the voices of Shyna and other characters far clearer than the Playstation. Same goes for the music.;1356;;American Playstation Version is way too difficult  The PlayStation version is missing all background animations  Scaling is off in the playstation version  The extra boss is definitely an afterthought  The Saturn version has no save feature, but loads much faster.

3048;;Its a cute little game, having a lot in common with original The Settlers series. The military is even more rudimentary though, so nothing interesting there. but the resource management is on par with its inspiration: number of different resouces is comparable, and logistics are far more advanced. However, at its current state (at the moment of review), this is also the games main downfall: while logistics offer robust gaming mechanics, they are also very buggy, so DONT EVEN TRY to build those fancy railways — good chances are, youll simply break a working colony and will have to either replay or spend quite a lot of time with height tool. Also, well, the food mechanics, while pretty standard, have a certain quirk when you thing that your robots are, well, robots.

You will be wandering about your very existence, perception and morality and think a lot about the experience for a good while after the game is finished.  The story is rich and I would recommend reading every bit of lore you stumble upon because side stories are the flavor that make SOMA a whole.  The monster hide and seek gameplay is the weakness of SOMA. Some players will like the challenge, others, like me, will see it a nuisance getting in the way of enjoying the story. This doesnt mean that monsters are uninteresting as each of them will require a different strategy.   However, if you plan to fully enjoy the story either play it on safe or have a second play through on safe. It is so much to be discovered! (keep in mind however that a full walkthrough will keep you on your seat 8 to 12 hours).;9727;;- monsters feel like a nuisance more than a scare and will make you miss things in the areas they patrol - choices in the game should have a bigger impact - will set the bar high for the next games you play :);;+++ WOW main story ++ interesting side stories ++ thought provoking ending ++ atmospheric;c;40108;224769

3054;;The Fallout 4 game is a game like many others that Ive played: One that Im afraid to finish. Maybe I shouldnt, because there are so many side-quests, the stories from the DLCs, etc. But theres a nice magic in playing the game and its side-quests while preserving the factions on the game. The challenge is maintained, and with these, the desire to play the game as a survival apocalyptic one.  Well, If Im at the end of the world, life should be difficult, plain difficult. And during the storyline in Fallout 4, it seems harsh on the others NPCs, but not on you. As you level-up, build protection on your settlements and choose your perfect set of armor, there are various strategies that are foolproof to defeat your enemies. Even if you can mod your way out to the best gameplay experience, this lack of more meaningful AI makes the game a little tiring at the end.   Even so, theres always a new quest to do, with fun and interesting story to catch, new items, lore to understand and more. Also, there are the companions! Interesting characters with lots of background story to tell, lines to talk, feeling a nice companion for your long life during the Fallout.  Technically, the game is perfect. Its addictive, interesting, and with modding, theres only more to do at the game. Its open-world, and as such, I think it should have something to put the player back on the tracks of the game, a purpose, a reward to be again onto the main campaign of the game. Because if the games tells a story, it should be one that the players is compelled to read until the end.;9630;;- Its so big, you end up delaying the End forever for better battles. - You also need to rely on Mods for better challenges, more difficult enemies, etc. As you Level Up, the vanilla game turns to be easy. - Not all DLCs deserves the price.;;+ Great customization on the character. + Lots of options for costumes, armors and etc. + The ability to build your home and your tools makes the game pretty addictive. + Various quests with interesting story and lore, making the game interesting as you play. + The world is vast, diverse, and chaotic beautiful. + Its a game that honor the previous games Fallout 3 and New Vegas, with the same gameplay, more features, and more choices. + Its colorful and really fun. + The DLCs adds nice content to the game, improved with modding.;c;40168;225117
3055;;A game with a perfect casting, perfect music, perfect scenario. The only negative point its at the end when youve done all the little activities you could possibly do.

The gameplay is good, during the story, when the open-world is interesting, meaningful, and the players run into lots of random encounters. The scenario is interesting, with nice little details that can be explored during the treasure hunt missions.  In the end, its a game that you play, understand the purpose of the game, and love it, looking to share with every friend you have.;434;;- Its really solitary once you end it, and made it through 100%.

3056;;I do not understand the sheer lauding of this game.  Yes, its better than the original with a deeper narrative that isnt so ambiguous.  Yes, it has better characterization, etc. etc.  But seriously this game was MEGA easy.  You could literally walk around maybe 80% of the enemies at all times and never take damage from them, and while the puzzles were sort of interesting, the rest of the world that was constructed either felt too cramped or too sparse.  In the end, the best I can say is it has pretty great visuals and sound design, but thats par for the course with Silent Hill games.

3057;;Jade Empire is a largely unknown RPG developed by BioWare, and released in 2005 for the OG Xbox- and later on the PC with the Special Edition in 2007, it released to critical acclaim, but was a financial flop- only shipping around 500,000 Units by 2007, and has kinda turned into a cult classic, (in fact I was actually introduced to the game through this group). Now that you know what this game is, let’s get into the review and see if it is for you  Gameplay- The gameplay is a cool mix of old BioWare elements and badass martial arts moves, the combat system is very smooth and fluid and was their most action-packed combat system, at least in the sense of previous BioWare RPGs (like KOTOR and NWN), you get multiple different styles of fighting that changes your way of fighting, and some enemies have resistances to fighting styles- making you change it up so the gameplay doesn’t get stale. Overall- it’s a fast, fluid, and fantastic combat system, in my opinion, it’s likely the strongest aspect of the game, and the difficulty is a little on the easier side if you play on normal (except at the end) but that can be easily fixed by putting the difficulty up).  Story- The story takes place in... Jade Empire (I know, so surprising) a beautiful eastern empire that has been corrupted by the emperor Sun Hai. You (AKA The spirit Monk) are a student at the Two Rivers Academy training under the illustrious and yet mysterious Master Li. However while training, a elite squadron of troops under the emperor known as the Lotus Assassins attack the Academy and take Master Li, this sets The Spirit Monk on his quest throughout the beauty of Jade Empire, meeting companions and doing fun quests. Overall the plot is rather predictable (Except for a pretty badass twist near the end!), not bad by any means, but kinda a good vs bad story, but the beauty of this story is the extremely likable characters and world building, it has that BioWare flare, definitely a great story, but definitely not BioWare’s best.  Quest Design- Overall, I would say this is the weakest part, many quests simply turn out to be “go to A and deal with B” which is pretty disappointing for BioWare, however there are some very great ones once you get into the Imperial City, but overall, it felt like an oversight, and a lot of the choices you made in the side quests were extremely empty and didn’t show up in the later game. Don’t get me wrong, the quests were mostly fun to do, but didn’t have that extra layer of depth that BioWare showed  Graphics- Since it was released in 2005, its expected to not be as good as 2018 (and is why is pretty negligible within my score system, but still important to mention), but I was still rather surprised, the world was SO beautiful, and sometimes I just had to stop and look at the world, but the characters are a little blocky and janky, also the animations are buttery smooth, even better than most games today  Music- I enjoyed the music, I don’t really have that much to say since I didn’t go into depth with the music theory of it, but it definitely fit the world  Closing Thoughts- Overall this game is a Hidden, but flawed, Gem. Not BioWare’s best, but if you love RPGs, and especially BioWare, you will love this game!  8/10;5867;;Quest Design;;Combat Characters;c;38814;225208

3060;;I went into this expecting basically an anime with QTEs. Which I wouldve really loved. Unfortunately the game is bogged bown by loads of bullet hell type sections and mediocre combat with uninteresting enemies. The boss fights rarely felt that exciting. Apart from the odd bit that I really liked (like someone stabbing a sword through the whole earth), most of it was forgettable. The story ended with so many loose ends it was really unsatisfying.  That game hasnt aged well either. Repeating textures and low res characters dont help when spectacle is all the game has going for it.;5495;;;;;c;16595;225314

You can literally RUN around almost EVERY single enemy, and the areas are so sparse and, while theyre realistic, they end up feeling extremely empty at times.  Like I said, an improvement, but not super exciting in the end.

3066;;Probably the best game Rockstar has made so far. It manages to improve just about every single aspect of RDR 1 while also adding new features and mechanics. And while I thoroughly enjoyed myself the entire way through, its not entirely perfect. Its a game where its hard to say whats good about it without being vague out of worry about spoiling things, and its hard to say whats bad about it without being specific and worrying that youre detracting focus from the excellent parts of the game. So here it goes;25076;;- Survival mechanics that while at first seem fleshed out and important, but dont actually effect much (other than your appearance and health bar) if you ignore them.  - Un-intuitive design, so much focus on realism that it becomes un-immersive: Just try buying yourself a full set of clothing without resorting to buying a preset outfit and youll see what I mean. Theres also something to be said about how annoying it is that your character will automatically stow their weapons away on the horse if you ride it for long enough without using them, especially since it isnt an action you control yourself. I found it incredibly frustrating how many times I had equipped weapons I wanted to use just before a mission, only to find that by the time the action begun  they had been stowed on my horse. Oh, and sometimes my weapons just outright disappeared from my horses inventory and I had to buy them again. Even the pause menu has suffered from a downgrade. Sub-menus have been divided into clunky boxes instead of simple horizontally layered options, and hovering over a sub-menu will no longer give you a preview of the options within it. The option to manually save and load your game is hidden away in the story section of the menu, which I didnt even find out until I was already many hours into the game.  Clunky controls: I find Rockstars default controls in their games incredibly weird. I dont see the point in having to hold X/A just to be able to walk faster. Its something that can work fine on keyboard and mouse, but on controllers we have analogue sticks. Meaning  if we want to walk we can just push the stick half way, and if we want to run/walk faster then we push it all the way. X/A being the run button also means you have to take your finger off of the aiming stick (unless you have a controller with paddles on the back). I also dont get why you can only swap shoulders while aiming, why the select/back button is for changing camera distance when they could of instead swapped it with the inventory button (which is instead bound to the right D-pad) to make for a more normal and simple control scheme. Why you cant re-cock your weapon while in cover? Why is punch bound to circle and block bound to square? Why is jump bound to square? Why picking up a weapon is bound to the same button that also holsters and un-holsters your weapon? (which can lead to accidental weapon swaps). Theyve also changed how running works from the first game  it doesnt automatically have you run when you have your weapon out any more, you have to hold X/A to do it, which I found quite annoying to get used to. There are a lot more problems but Im not gonna go on about it further.  - Clunky animations related to controls: while the animations might look impressive, it certainly doesnt feel impressive when youre trying to pick up a gun off of the floor, and the game is asking you instead if you want to pick up a nearby hat or body. Not to mention how rigid some of them are. For example, to loot a body you need to be standing in front of their legs, so even if youre right next to them and your character could theoretically just lean over and take the item off of their chest, he will instead move into position next to their legs so he can pick them up off of the floor to take it. The same thing can happen for searching drawers/cupboards as well as taking the items inside of them.  - Inconsistent writing (the examples I use are made up hyperbole to avoid spoiling actual events in the game and give you the clearest idea of what I mean): There are multiple occasions where in cutscenes your character will say one thing, but then in the game you are only given the option to say the opposite thing. Basically  in one scene he might say you shouldnt do ______, and then in gameplay your talk option will have him completely flip sides and say you should do ______. This isnt a super common thing across the entirety of the game (you might not even come across this, depending on how much you talk to characters in game), but it happened a few times for me at (some were at really important story moments too) and it was incredibly distracting and annoying. I also have a problem with how unsubtle Rockstar can be. This game suffers a lot from the trope of characters saying stuff like haha after this im gonna go and kiss my wife then immediately dying or getting badly wounded immediately after. Its never quite as bad as the example I made up, but it happens a lot. Sometimes it also feels like the writer is trying to talk through the characters, and it can lead to characters acting not quite like themselves. For example, a character might say after recently discovering smoking was bad for them  man, this whole time ive been smoking because i thought it was cool and fine. but now ive learned the dark truth! to think that smoking was bad all this time, and i was just going along with it without knowing any better!. Again, it isnt quite as blatant as my example but I hope you get what I mean.;;- Good animation and graphics - Vast open world with tons of side content   - Incredibly long and satisfying story campaign - Fantastic sound and music - Great voice performances all round, with very few exceptions.;c;35833;225835

3072;;The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind Review:  (Note: This game was played on Xbox One through backwards compatibility and I had a copy for my original Xbox that I picked up back in 2014)  The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind is a CRPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios and Published by Bethesda Softworks in 2002 to massive critical acclaim and was a massive financial success allowing Bethesda to survive as a company because at the time they were under massive financial constraints. But now that you know about the game lets get into whether or not this game is for you.  But to start off, this game is very, very difficult- it will kick the shit out of you, and there is zero hand-holding, no map markers, no checkpoints, no fast travel (except for public transport which costs gold) and if you prefer your games to not make you work for progression, then this game is not for you. Also the journal is very messy, but its easy to get over.  Im splitting the review into four sections: Combat, Exploration/World, Story/Dialogue, and Presentation  -Combat: The combat is old school, this game is based around dice rolls and chance rather than projectile, as your chance to hit and damage is raised with your skills, personally I love this system but is infuriating at the start, as if you spec your character wrong youre gonna have a bad time (It took me 1 minute to kill a rat, AND I DIED TO THE RAT) but once you start leveling your skills itll become a lot easier but never loses its challenge (unless you level perfectly, as someone was able to kill the final god Dagoth Ur with his fists, but it is virtually impossible for someone starting out), as the game is balanced very well and teaches you that youre not a badass dragon slayer, but merely a mortal (although you pretty much ascend to go. So this combat system is not for everyone, but I love it!  -Exploration/World: This is easily the best world Bethesda has ever created, there is always something interesting around every corner, and the design is so unique and well crafted, it takes inspiration from Asian Cultures, Middle Eastern, High Fantasy, etc. This is simply a world that you wont see in any other game. And the Exploration as I said is always interesting and unique, after spending well around 100 hours in this game Im finding new unique things, not just re-skinned things like in the later Elder Scrolls games basically making it the most re-playable Elder Scrolls.  -Story/Dialogue: You play as a prisoner taken from the Imperial city prison under the order of The Emperor Uriel Septim VII as you are destined to be the Nerevarine, and you are set out on the quest to help the Tribunal and stop Dagoth Ur. The plot is very good, however the way its told is very exposition heavy (I.E: Tolkien-Esque) which will turn people off, but I found myself very engaged, as the exposition (which is all text based by the way, pretty much no voice acting) is very well written, its akin to reading a book, if you dont like to read- you will be turned off from this game. Overall, I loved it, but is not for everyone.  -Presentation: Im putting this last as its the least important in my score system, but still needs to be talked about. And this game is beautiful.... somewhat. The world is beautiful and easily holds up 16 years later, however, the character models are blocky and janky, the animations are stiff, and very old. But that being said, it doesnt take away from the score. Also, the soundtrack is FANTASTIC and shows Jeremy Soules greatness as a composer. But I personally prefer Skyrims soundtrack a bit more, but this is a great score  -Closing Thoughts: This game is nothing short of fantastic... for the right person, and is the BEST Elder Scrolls game, and actually incorporates choice and consequence rather than following the streamlined roleplaying of Oblivion or Skyrim (I still love those games, dont get me wrong). If youre longing for a punishing but rewarding CRPG experience, you will find it here. I fucking love this game, but it is a slow burn, however if youre able to get over that, it is nothing short of a CRPG Masterpiece!  Final Score: 10/10!;56;;Minor Glitches;;World Combat Story;c;38814;225203
3073;;Rockstars Grand Theft Auto V beautifully returns to Los Santos. Not only does the game bring the Grand Theft Auto franchise to new heights, it also sets a new standard to the action/adventure open world sandbox that Rockstar crafts so delicately. Whether you are a fan of the Rockstar formula, or picking up a GTA for the first time, this game has more than enough to offer. With an engaging story, intriguing characters, gorgeously crafted city, and freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want will keep you coming back for more. With a release on the 7th and 8th generation of consoles, this game is accessible to almost anyone. Although, the Xbox 360 and PS3 release feels unfinished, with pixelation, little environmental reactions to the player, and stale lighting, the Xbox One, PS4, or PC way is to go.  Grand Theft Auto V is a must have for any video game fan, whether you experience story, race and rob online with your friends, cause havoc, or just turn it on to cruise the highway and listen to the flawless soundtrack, this game will stick with you for a very long time.;1020;;-Limited online customization -Car physics are similar -Unfinished 7th Generation release;;-Great Story -Exciting Gameplay -Outstanding Graphics -Unique open sandbox;c;40446;226389
3074;;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is massive.  Not only does the map, customization, and combat feel immersive, it leaves you wanting more. Bethesdas 2011 Juggernaut offers an amazing RPG experience for fans of the genera, and newcomers alike. Set in the beautiful continent of Tamriel, you embark on a journey as the Dragon born. The story is yours, how YOU want to play it, and that is a Bethesda trope that will never leave you dissatisfied.  Out of all of the things Bethesda did right with Skyrim, the main story is the weakest part. The game really shines with the side quests, such as the dark brotherhood story line. Exploration is also a key point, which always is rewarding, leaving you wanting to search every corner of the map. Bethesda really put their heart in soul into creating a unique, immersive world, and they delivered. This game may have a generic story, but it does not alter the experience. Skyrim has held up over the last 7 years, and will go down as a classic. Enjoyed by many for years to come.;472;;-Occasional disruptive glitches -Generic Story;;-Immersive gameplay -Rewarding exploration -Replay-ability;Review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;40446;226390
3075;;The Witcher is CD Projekt Reds passion project, no doubt about that, and you can really see the passion in The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. First of all, this game is gorgeous, with a blazing sun beating down on the beautiful red leaves of Autumn, to the lightning showers of spring, this game is a treat to look at. Geralt of Rivera returns for a third and final time, along with a big ensemble of characters that push the story to great heights. This game is in depth, very in depth, and it works, flawlessly. From leveling up Geralt, playing Gwent, to the combat system, this game delivers. The story is what makes this game special, although the side fetch quests can rarely become repetitive.

3076;;One thing that surprises me that when my wife told me about most of games I play involve killing people. And that is not good thing.  So it is just me. I just recently finished this game, its about a brave unskilled young lady stranded in mysterious island with her peers in searching artifacts where my wife likes watching me playing the game.  My wife likes Lara Croft and told she is beautiful and told the game is so unrealistic, yeah ofcourse. Her soap opera is more unrealistic with lowest common denominator of plot writing. But, we enjoy this video game movie where most of time my wife just say some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ about how I play. (  Also, one thing I will remember in one scene where one of Lara friends dying get shot by enemies and she tries to wake him up and said Wake Up, you Northener Bastard!!!! Wow, For me, its like peak of dialogue writing. Imagine you say same thing in real life XD  Game is 8/10 will play the next sequel.;1164;;pointless dlc dead multiplayer;6;Realistic take and gritty Challenging puzzle  Good CGI acting;A Survivor Rises;38235;218247

3078;;So, I invest my most of time playing this FPS game that approximately spending 500 hours of grinding and also spent much money for cosmetics such skin for 50$ and more. Nothing to regret playing free to play beta game with eye candy characters and also interesting mechanic to train my reflex for fast paced shooters where I enjoy the game mostly for casual play.  And here I am, after spending 500 hours and grinding each characters for leveling each characters to reach 10 level, I think I am kind of done playing online game like this all this year and back to my productive sessions or playing some good-narrative video games and leave some review on Steam, maybe I just play less than three matches and done.  In each session, i was rage for stupid team-mates who dont know their role and it also gives ego-fest for each players who think playing team based games just go random jihad and blindly attack enemy.  I was so satisfied with intense and competitive session where everyone take things seriously and ended have good game pops up on chat section where even though we are losing, players just get satisfied to get balance and intense battle. Sometimes, i face most dumbos enemy that are too easy to beat and lag is the only factors to decide are you going to win or not instantly.  I think this is the game where I was so doubt that free to play strategy wont attract players spending their wallet for cosmetics, guess I was so wrong.. the way game is marketed so appealing and most of the cosmetics for each characters dont have that buyer remorse to have. I bought the founder pack for unlocking each characters and also VIP membership where I think its because I fully support the developer to make this game is going full potential because its still on development.  The only thing I expect from this game is single player mode with lore and things to do for specific mission against bots, not only pushing payloads or 5v5 random battle for grinding and unlocking loot boxes to improve characters ability  Paladins is kind of game where you have to be ready to understand what if FPS is mixed with moba skills where each characters should have be mastered to gain satisfying gameplay, and also it has competitor with high price tag while this game is free but if you like it, you wont mind to buy for full price.;11544;;buggy laggy incompetent team mate money stealer cause skins;;eye candy characters have own unique battle system solid player base free;c;38235;219426
3079;;Oh boy... What can I say about writing this awesome game after finishing it for approximately 15 hours of having exciting and thrilling adventor in a city below the sea called Rapture. The gloomy athmosphere 60s retro vibe with stunning 3D graphic, philosophical based of Ayn Rand take on Objectivism ideas, and simple and yet challenging gameplay FPS mechanic involving arms with guns and body genetic modification where you can throw fire, ice, wind, and other things with your bare hands defeating various kind of deformed human. Bioshock 1 is where you can bring philosophical ideas into video games with perfect gameplay mechanic. And this is what I want to say for the first of paragraph of my review.  PLOT :   Its 1950, You are an average John who flights across the ocean where suddenly your flight got crashed and you are survivor in the middle of ocean where there is only a lighthouse that leads you into a beautiful city under the sea that is apprently all of the residents are corrupted by advanced genetic body modification and also aftermath of idealistic city built by Andrew Ryan. The man who thinks that the world dont need limitations in science advancement, art works, and also established government system.   In other word, he is the one you will face and fight alongside mysteries that you have to unravel the glory days and the downfall of Rapture by finding some audio records left with help from survivor called Atlas where you communicate using radio wave to find your escape from savage modified human like residents turned into addicts for your ADAM, your genetic substance where there are two iconic ADAM hunterer like Big Daddies and Little Sister that you can fight for your own benefit by using weapons to find or using PLASMIDS that simply makes you powerful to control any substance like fire burst, electro charge, and many more to make you stronger after beating Big Daddies and later you have to choose whether to kill little sister by harvesting her ADAM, or save her where those choices it will affects your ending and also your moral compass.  CONTROL :  Bioshock 1 is first-person shooters where basically you can play using keyboards with mouse and also game-pad. It has smooth movement for character movement and easy to use weapon and abilty function that has less rpg mechanic and depend of looting system where you can get some money, first aid, some proper ammo to battle specific enemies by killing enemies or find those hidden on various object you can find alongside the location where you can rely on the arrow cursor to guide you. It seems easy to play, but in some encounter you have to consider and make strategy to prepare enemy attacks because every bullets counts and using your special ability what makes this game more fun, such throwing stuffs, make flammable floor or doing hack for machine that against you such as cctv and turret guns.  VISUAL :  The game came in 2008 and it revolutionized and introduced the new graphic of what Unreal Engine is capable of. Even though Bioshock 1 has limited area to explore, the vibe of being under the sea with astonishing landscape of Rapture city through the window makes this games has its own identity where beautifully background location setting with thrilling sense of claustrophobia. Some objects through the location such paintings, ads, and radio can be the hint and to reveal the plotline in case you miss and perfectly crafted to support your progress to understand what does it like being in Rapture city.  The music and sounds effect represents of vintage feel and fits with the theme properly. The voice acting that you can hear through records and radio is top-notch and makes story more believable with key characters to give you guidance and knowledge with the setting.  FUN :  For a FPS fan genre, Bioshock is not average shooter that relies on the machine gun only, but it requires to use your strategy how you can use ability and makes advantage of objects such as shooting gasoline leaks with fire or electrocute water floor to make enemies more vulnerable. There are also bunch of abilities to explore to progress the game to make it easier.  Bioshock has looting elements which means you can take money and particular items from enemy you kill where later you can spend on it to buy healts, eve (for using ability), bullets and explosives. Storyline wise, Bioshock 1 has more mature theme with its own objectivism philosophy without shoving theories and the game gives you the foundation and description on how Objectivism work, if you never touch the subject before. Its like the introduction to you and the aftermath if you finish the game and like the concept. You may be interested to read Atlas Shrugged and The Fountain Head just like I do.  Now, would you kindly do the same?  Rating 9/10 would kindly recommended.;20;;some enemies are too hard not suited for children;6;underwater level that everyone like decent and revolutionary graphic-wise serious theme for serious game;Perfect Adaption of Philosophical Work into Video Game Medium;38235;212442
3080;;The only I remember about Spec Ops franchise back when my childhood days, its on Playstation X where the gameplay resembles and looks like Army Men franchise but with real soldiers as character you play in the realistic setting, after long years forgotten I found this game recommended as a game that every shooters and military genre fans should try. I played and finished this game twice when for the first time, I played it curiously because of the unconventional plot and great storyline about how bad the outcome of being in combat and military environment to question your morality as in the process to finish the game. And secondly, I re-played for fun and also make little bit different choices on the gameplay where SO:TL is basically third person shooter with linear plot but still give choices to its player to see what will we choose for better decisions on combat that later affects how we see the characters we play (that basically the player themselves) about the deed we have done every each chapter. One thing for war : Kill or be killed, or you dont have to?  Here is my review:   PLOT :  You are Martin, an idealistic soldier with high rank as captain. Along with your two partner and subordinate. You are deployed into a post-natural disaster state on Dubai, a city that was wiped by the standstorms. And here is your task, a simple task: Find survivors and mysterious radio signal that presumed as evacuation from inner city with civilian survivors and armies that you have to face in combat and later leads you into a journey of our main character mental state of mind choices where your partner question a lot about your decision into deep rabbit hole with the intense of inside city battles which you dont fight your enemy but also your sanity.   As a military shooter game, the plot will drag you into philosophical questions about choices and your realization (as player) to continue fighting and also SO:TL will deconstruct the whole thing of being what is right and what is wrong in military combat with realitic touch how are you the hero of this story when you have to fight what you tought is right as your duty.  CONTROL :  Grab your controller or simply use mouse+keyboard, the control is pretty responsive with stunning graphic and dynamic camera movement that shows third person perspective which makes this game easy to enjoy and not really hard when you are in combat, I personally use normal mode and found its challenging because as in combat you have to think on every single move you have to do. As main character, you can bring two type of guns and explosives where you can find along the gameplay or you can simply grab your enemy weapons after being taken down. As a captain, you can order your two partners (as AI) to use their skills in order to solve the thightness in some combats where they can shoot specific enemies or doing distractions to move forward. The gameplay set some realitic tone when it comes to your health system, you wont see any healtbar or indicator, just avoid massive of gunfires from enemy or you instantly being killed, your character can survive if your partners maintain their distance in order to save you if you are taken down. Probably, the annoying side of control system is when the cover system in combat have false detection in deciding to take cover or moving forward.    VISUAL :  Enjoy stunning visual of post-disaster state of Dubai where sky scrappers are being torn and crushed buried among desert hills, walk and explore straight into miserable places of war casualties and what left that you will experience. Some parts are athmospheric and you may find some disturbing scenes (that involves with the plot) This game visual will touch your minds (literally) and your character mind when they face some odd strange situations where leads you into questioning, are you enjoying this kind of game, or you just feel something else. Moreover, this game have to offer interesting side of how music really influences how you perceive this game as serious but sometimes (in the early parts of games) it have the fun part of musical cues that can be enjoyed while you shoot everyone. The voice acting are top-notch and convincing that the characters you are playing have the situation as in the game.  FUN :   SO : TL have good tier storyline where I assumed eventhough the plot sounds cliche at the first time (about a soldier being a hero and typical American shooters where glorifies its greatness and you act like another Rambo in this game, eventually, I was wrong. This games have no fun when you really think of how it projects what is great being American soldier or simple being a soldier when facing the outcome what you did on the entire gameplay. Yes, you do mass killing people and blow some ♥♥♥♥♥ to progress, its fun on video game medium. But when SO : TL approaches of realistic tone of this kind of genre. It has the plus point where I stated this game deconstructs what is kind of type shooter genre looks like mostly, and this game prove us wrong.   If you like playing shooter game with great storyline and message, grab this game and experience your state of thought will be filled the consequences of various feeling on your main character decision and choice by the hand of yourself as the player in the challenging of combat system but still rewards you an thought-provolong experience.

3081;;To be fair, writing this review should be divided into two kind of aspects.  First of all, the technical issue, this game is barely out-dated so everyone can run the game flawlessy and I had nothing problem on running it on the latest gpu such gtx1060 with i7 processor. You have to install Windows Live first to run the game if you encounter error issue such the game wont start properly.  The second thing, ofcourse its about gameplay. So lets get started with the plot.  PLOT  You are Kane, an ex-criminal that do revenge against to your crime organization because they kill your family and must save your daughter that is kidnapped. In order to do that, you dont do it alone, you will be accompanied by Lynch, a troubled temperamental guy who swears alot. He helps you during the gameplay and mission which you must shoot everyone from police to Yakuza where the gameplay is basically just getting from point A to B and so on with interesting feature such as commanding your partner or your groups (on some mission) to face your enemy for killing.   Story-wise its over-used theme and the dialouge are territbe, for personal reasons, I cant see the reason why the writers here write their every single characters in this game have swearing lines that were not necessary and exaggerating in order to convince the character you play is not average good guy trope. Its like written by an edgy writer who thinks that character who swears a lot is great to convince the player that has unique personality, and the problem almost single of characters here sound same with angry attitude.   CONTROL  This game requires keyboard and mouse to control, so if you have controller/joystick its useless. The problem with the control mechanic is really awful in aiming for far range. You have to remember precisely which the keyboard button function for exact control. The most annoying thing that this game dont have jump button which in one mission I almost being stuck to continue my gameplay, and besides please be patient that your movement isnt smooth enough to move with confusing camera movement and auto-hiding feature that is glitchy. But overall, still you can enjoy game if you get used with default controlling mapping if you dont play this game often.   VISUAL   Its little bit out-dated but still cannot categorized into retro game considering this game came out in mid 00s. The facial movement looks stiff and sometimes ridiculously weird with characters moving their lips on dialoge unsynchronized and you can find bug here and there during the gameplay.   FUN  For the game that you can spend for more 5 hours, this game can potentially be fun for third-person shooting genre, but considering this game is not controller / joystick ready and have lack of story-line interesting plot. You can still add to your collection but for me, Its really hard to see what is the replay value from this game and maybe I never look back because the only thing makes thie game interesting is probably its kind of starter to explore third-person genre on PC that is cheap to try on Steam (bought on sale).   P.s : too bad, there is no such button beside yes or no on steam, id like to put maybe.

3082;;Very few studios manage to craft a world so interesting and lively that you lose yourself in them. One such studio is Rockstar games. Every game from them builds upon their last, creating everlasting improvement. Red Dead Redemption 2 was no exception. In fact, the newest entry in their fantastic catalog is their most impressive and immersive game to date. A game that proves that world-building is more captivating than useless busy-work.  What I love about Rockstar is that they put so much attention into the worlds they create. I would describe this games open-world as a character itself. Not only was it absolutely gorgeous, with its beautiful mountain tops and thick atmospheric weather effects, but it was full of colorful people to interact with. I spent hours exploring every nook and cranny discovering unique and interesting characters. May it be a series of eerie clues leading to the location of a vampiric man or a drunken war vet telling you the story of how he was betrayed by his best friend  almost around every corner was a new interesting face to meet. These small interactions were eons more exciting and enticing than any typical base take-down mission or tower to climb. The game, also, never bogged me down with mission icons flooding the map. Much of the side content wasnt even on the map, instead, it left me to venture out myself and discover them. I found this to be much more enthralling since I wasnt just opening my map to find the next side activity to check it off a list.   If I wanted to find these activities and missions I had to explore. Exploring this world for these missions often led me to many interesting locations that contained compelling sites. I was always excited to find a cave or house, not because of loot or weapons, but because these hidden areas contained stories just through attention to detail. There werent just tons of notes to inform you about the location, although there were at times and they were always an interesting read. But instead many of these secret locations had their history written through the atmosphere surrounding them and their design. At times I might have even come across cool easter eggs on the supernatural side of things, which was always fun to experience. Secret areas were always fun to explore, but the bustling towns and city streets were also fun to hang around in. In these towns, many shops and activities were opened up for interaction. Shops were mainly a vehicle for items to aid you on your journeys and mix and match clothing to customize your look. Bars were also available for a time of unwinding and rest as you can rent a room or take a bath to cleanse yourself. But the one set of activities that were always fun to come across in these towns were definitely the mini-games. Poker and Five-Finger Fille were the two games I came across. I know jack all about poker, but from what I could tell it seemed to have enough depth and strategy to keep other people playing. Five-Finger Fille, however, was pretty addictive and easy to learn. These mini-games, although not abundant, were fun to get lost in and added a nice little distraction from all the shooting.   Speaking of shooting, hunting this time around was a lot more expansive and involving. Instead of simply shooting an animal and skinning it, the system here was added for more strategic play. The ability to study an animal was neat as it helped pinpoint weak points to ensure a good pelt for selling. I was glad they added this mechanic since hunting has always disinterested me due to how simplistic it usually is presented. Fishing was added to the game, as well, as a nice companion activity to hunting. Unfortunately, the controls were a bit clunky when reeling in fish, making it a bit difficult to catch them. It wasnt a huge issue, but one nonetheless. Many of these activities were also integrated into more overarching stories. Many side-missions had hunting and mini-games but were presented through interesting characters and extra tasks. Most of the side-missions were multilayered and offered more insight into the different mechanics fused with the side-activities. But, side-activities werent the only thing expanded upon in these missions, as main protagonist, Arthur Morgan, was given a lot more understanding through these missions.  Id say that Arthur Morgan is one of the best video game protagonists Ive played as in a long time. His development from beginning to end was enthralling and emotional. His tough guy persona, in the beginning, was one that seemed typical for the generic western hero. His actions and experiences he went through transformed him, by the end, into a character that was not only sympathetic but extremely likable. It helped that he was incredibly charismatic and funny due to the excellent dialogue and phenomenal voice work by Roger Clark. However, he wasnt the only interesting and excellently performed character. Since the games plot revolved around your gang, run by Dutch Van der Linde, and the downfall of it, a lot of focus went into the characters. Each of the characters were fleshed out. Since the gang and you hold out at different camps, there was the ability to sit around a campfire or play mini-games to further get to understand your fellow members. There were even side-missions available for you to further explore your their pasts and introduce fun gameplay elements, such as robbing certain locations. However, the people residing in your camp could also start to dislike you if you dont donate money for camp upgrades or dont provide meat for them to use. I found this mechanic to give a nice dynamic nature to the relationships between you and them. You could even antagonize them, through the small interaction menu, if you dont enjoy their presence. Even though all of the gang were interesting, the one member that stuck out was Dutch. Dutchs downward spiral was not only expertly paced out and executed, but one that brought about an emotionally driven second half of the narrative. Towards the end, he went from a charming and fun character into one of quick-witted decision making and greed-filled corruption. This effectively made his turn to villainy as one of the best origin stories for a villain Ive ever seen. All these characters were what made this games story so captivating, and it contained an epilogue that wrapped up the story beautifully.   Not only was the story engaging, but the story missions contained so many unique game-play elements and scenarios. Sure, most of them ended with a shootout, and Id say a few times it felt kind of forced. However, the gun-play here is probably Rockstars best combat system to date. The weight behind every gunshot was satisfying and was aided by the phenomenal animations and sound design. Speaking of, the game had a multitude of weapons. There were various gun-shops around each of the towns that contained different types of weaponry. Shotguns, rifles, pistols, revolvers, melee, etc. Each of which contained their own customization options and strengths and weaknesses when it came to different situations. Horses have, also, been focused on a lot more in terms of customization and stats. Whether you tame a horse in the wild or buy one, each of them came with their own special statistics, with some horses being more suited for certain environments than others. Horse customization, this time around, was way more varied, and even a bit overwhelming. But I was grateful with the amount of personalization available.  Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game I never thought Id see anytime soon. It was an open-world game that sucked me in like no other. Its many game-play systems, fantastically realized world, and enthralling story added it up as one of my favorite games this generation. Its not a perfect game, as some clunkiness was present and the epilogue contained a few boring missions. But in the face of everything, the accomplishments completely shadowed over the flaws.;25076;;- Few weak story missions - Some clunkiness at times, but nothing that hurt my experience.;48;- Great game-play - Fantastic cast of characters that elevate the story and were amazingly written. - An excellent open world with depth - Highly addictive side-activities as they dont feel like busy work.;Review: Red Dead Redemption 2;38638;226172

3084;;This game was utterly infuriating.  Where to begin: first, the combat was total garbage- locking onto enemies is helpful and having the charge up mechanic is a nice edition, but the enemies are GARBAGE.  Theyre either too agile or too annoying to deal with- not fun in the slightest.  Second, the necessity in the game of needing to return to the titular Room was so unbelievably tedious.  It was just so repetitive and a slog to get through.  Third, the second half of the game BLOWS when you basically turn into a babysitter and have to protect Eileen the entire time.  Keeping her from taking too much damage is nearly impossible, especially with the Ghost enemies that never stop coming.  A huge step down for Silent Hill games.  Nice graphics though.

3088;;I borrowed this game from my uncle for the PS3 about 2 years ago and I got to the Goodsprings or Powder Ganger decision and I picked the Powder Ganger one on accident and then I said man f*ck this why would you want to pick that,thats so stupid and then I played Fallout 3 and really liked that. After I learned how the fallout formula worked I went back to Fallout New Vegas to play it again. To put it simply. I have roughly 250 hours on the PS3 version and 180 hours on the PC version.  The reason why I have so many hours on this game and why its my favorite game of all time is that its a perfect RPG. A game that allows you to play almost however you want. Fallout 4 was a garbage RPG for these reasons: It didnt let you play as whatever you wanted. Fallout 4 was restricted with its roleplaying. Had a voiced character and backstory. Fallout New Vegas DOESNT have a voiced character. Fallout New Vegas DOESNT have a character backstory. Fallout New Vegas DOES have great RPG elements.  I have 180 hours because of the replayability the game has because you can play as so many different things. Wanna be a goody two shoe character? You can. Wanna be a cruel despicable marauder? You can. Wanna be a flawed chem addict/alcoholic? You can. Wanna be a guy with an identity crisis that cant decide right from wrong and cant decide between NCR or Legion? You can.  I so far have had 4 playthroughs on the PC (Yes Man, Mr. House, NCR, and Legion playthroughs) and 6 PS3 playthroughs and I still cant get tired of this game (the only reason I dont play that often anymore is because I modded it to death and it crashes too often). If youve played Fallout 3, and never played 1-2 youll probably like New Vegas. If youve played 1-2 and hate 3 youll idolize New Vegas. If you liked Fallout 4, shame on you. If you hated Fallout 4 and want Obsidian to make the next one, youll idolize New Vegas. If you love the Elder Scrolls series, youll love New Vegas.   Although the game is my favorite game of all time it certainly has some flaws. The combat is clunky. The graphics are kinda ugly and the voice acting is very dull.The game crashes a lot and runs poorly like most Bethesda games but most of this can be fixed with mods. Oh my god mods. Mods. There are so many mods for this game.And if you dislike almost anything in the game, mods are there for you baby.  Final Verdict: If youre a fan of RPG this will be the best game for you, but if youre looking for a shooty shooty game, Id go for Fallout 4. New Vegas isnt for everybody but there is a special somebody for all of us, and for best of us, its New Vegas.;16;;;;;c;40596;227689
3089;;Ive always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with Fallout 3. At first, I disliked the game for its buggy and clunky gameplay. After giving the game a chance I enjoyed it, but after spoiling myself with the greatness of New Vegas, I came back not liking Fallout 3 as much. I modded it on PC to my liking and enjoyed it for a while until it started repeatedly crashing. Despite my back and forth feelings for this game, I believe the overall feeling is positive. Keep in mind this review is based more on personal enjoyment rather complete objectivity, which is only fair because I gave New Vegas a 10.   First of all, as someone who was introduced to the Fallout series through this game, I was never familiar with the previous installments until much later, which is why I believe I didnt like the game for a while. The game ditches a lot of the things that make the original two games so great. It leaves out a lot of the true RPG elements. Sure you can choose what to say, you can be good or evil, you can level up and choose perks, but you never feel like you really are your character. Fallout 1 and New Vegas do a fantastic job at making your character feel realistic and relatable which is why your actions and choices are important. You feel no connection to The Lone Wanderer. Why do I want to find my Dad? Hes in the game for like 20-30 minutes, the only connection I have to him is that hes voiced by Liam Neeson.   The world of Fallout 3 is interesting on the surface, with towns full of interesting characters and long questlines, but behind this is a landfill of worthless locations with nothing of interest. Half of these locations exist only to give extra Super Mutant, Raider and Enclave camps to clear out and loot. Going out of my way to explore all of these locations showed me that each uninteresting location has the same exact formula. Kill everyone inside that is a threat. Look around and loot everything that has any worth. There is no lore. There is nothing that adds depth to the world. Its all there for you to shoot and loot.   Speaking of shooting, the shooting mechanics in this game are pretty bad. You pretty much need VATS in order to actually be able to shoot anything. Not to mention the lack of Iron Sights. Having to aim with the inaccurate crosshairs that barely even show where your bullet is gonna go. Whats even worse is that VATS is immersion breaking and unattractive. If youre going to turn a turn-based RPG game into a modern FPS then at least to do the FPS part right!   Oh man not to mention how TERRIBLE the optimization of this game is. First of all, its a game of roulette if the game even launches when you buy it if you play on anything later than WINDOWS XP until you go into the code of the game and fix TWO LINES. Even then the game will constantly crash until you install Third-Party Mods to fix the game. Even AFTER you fix the game with mods, it still crashes after 5-10 minutes of playing. WHAT THE ****   While I know Ive been trash talking Fallout 3 this whole review, there is something to love about it. The characters are fantastic (even if half of them are done by the same 20 voice actors) and each questline is interesting and unique. There are things to enjoy in Fallout 3, for me its finding small details that require me to use my own imagination to fill in gaps (even though thats not really something to credit to the developers).   Would I recommend Fallout 3? No. The game is buggy, broken and uninspired. Despite me enjoying some of it, I would recommend Fallout: New Vegas or the first two fallout games;15;;;;;c;40596;227691
3090;;At first, when I played this I thought the writing was satire but apparently, people think this is actually well written. Its realistic, its how college campus students actually talk, but its so annoying and unlikeable.   The Time Travel mechanic makes no sense. Why does Max get a nosebleed before Kate kills herself? PLOT. Why does Chloes death and nothing else that Max does affect everything such as answering the question in the beginning? Also, why does Max get her powers? Why can she suddenly travel through time through pictures? NONE of this is explained.   CHLOE IS A TERRIBLE CHARACTER. Shes an annoying histper character that the creators ACTUALLY try to make us care about. If they made her intentionally annoying and we are only supposed to like her because Max likes her and because this is Maxs point of view, like a good video game would, then it would be good writing, but this isnt a good video game. Its barely a video game. More on that later. All the characters are trash. Max is bland and uninteresting. Warden is a cuck. Victoria is other there to be the b*tch character and Nathan is other there to hate. Nathan does become kind of good character after he releases he done diddley goofed and Mr. Jefferson is well written though, I will give them that as well.   And the choices, oh the choices. The game tries to be a telltale game (dont know why you would want to) and gives you choices such as WATERING YOUR PLANT. And saving a girl from suicide. A girl that is inconsistent to the plot. The game tries to tell you that these choices matter. You are told this for 4 episodes. Then it becomes clear that you were just lied to and the game takes a massive steamy sh*t on itself and gives you two choices. Two. Save the annoying c*nt Chloe or kill everyone else. This really shows how effortless of an ending it gives you. Plus, the ending where you save Chloe is like 3 minutes long showing they REALLY didnt care  .  And finally. The game isnt a game. You walk around with an absurdly annoying shoulder camera and collect f*cking bottles and hold down a button to rewind time and then click one of four options to say. Thats not a video game.   All around Life is Strange has a few good moments such as the twist that Mr. Jefferson is the killer and there are a few funny moments but thats all hidden behind terrible storytelling and even worse writing. Episode one is free on steam. If you want to check that out and quickly discover how terrible it is. The bathroom scene is honestly what did it for me;7599;;The art direction is annoying.

3091;;The game is good for what it is, and what it is, is just Tetris but Mario branded. Like, yea, of course the game is fun since the Tetris formula is brilliant but does that make this game brilliant? Nah, not really. Ill give this game credit since it easily couldve been an uninspired combination of Mario and Tetris but they took a unique approach and came up with a concept that would stick and would become so iconic that it was added as a fighter in Super Smash Brothers Melee and SSB4.;3476;;Its just Tetris bro.

3092;;I love this game! Its my first foray into the monster hunter games and its excellent, Ive spent over a hundred hours in it.

3093;;Fallout 4 Review  Fallout 76 is only few days away, and I decided to replay Fallout 4 (and Im deciding to review it because its the 3rd anniversary of the game), and my opinion has lightened, but this game is far from a masterpiece that people tout it as, so lets get into this to see whether or not its for you.  Fallout 4 is an Action RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and Published by Bethesda Softworks in 2015 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC, this game was released to massive financial success and critical acclaim, basically causing Fallout to be a mainline RPG series rather than being an obscure RPG series on the PC. However, a lot of Fallout fans completely railed this game for its streamlined RPG mechanics, and dumbed-down gameplay. However lets get into it.  Story- You are the Sole Survivor, the lone survivor from Vault 111, after seeing you baby taken from the Vault and your spouse killed right in front of your eyes, you bow to find your child and avenge your spouse but it slowly turns into a tale to change the commonwealth through some of the Factions This story is okay, not terrible, not great. The plot has some massive lore jump and logic jumps, but besides that, its predictable and inoffensive, the pacing is pretty good though, also a lot of the characters are poorly written and feel like theyre only there to give you shitty radiant quests (Preston >:-( !!!) however there are some very well written characters such as Nick Valentine. However it seems to be a rehash of Fallout 3s story, up until the second act So its okay, predictable and inoffensive, but, Okay.  Dialogue: Easily the worst part about this game, and theres this copypasta to basically sum up my thoughts with it:  A baby is drowning in the lake:  -Fallout 1  Ask for more information Agree to help Decide not to help Accidentally say something that pisses the NPC off, failing the quest Reveal too much information about yourself, causing the Super Mutants to track your vault more easily  -Fallout 2  Ask for more information Agree to help Decide not to help Accidentally say something that pisses the NPC off, failing the quest Pop culture reference about the baby  -Fallout 3 Yes, I will save the baby Depends on the caps I will not save the baby [Intelligence] The baby is drowning  -Fallout New Vegas I will save the baby I will not save the baby [Barter 30] Double the caps and Ill save the baby [Medicine 30] Thanks to my medical knowledge, I will easily be able to save the baby [Survival 15/30] Uh... yeah, I totally know how to swim  -Fallout 4 Yes No (Yes) Sarcastic (Yes) Hate babies  As you can see its an extreme downgrade of the RPG mechanics and prevents you from actually role-playing a character that you want  World- The world is absolutely beautiful, and it seems that every single place was extremely meticulously crafted, and there is always a story in every single area, and this definitely shows where all of the time went to. I love it!!!  Combat: This definitely had a ton of work, and it allows me to play the game and not use vats, the system is smooth, fluent, and responsive, and with the crafting it allows me to specialize my combat style. Hell I just love the crafting and was a great addition to it. Overall was extremely fun and had a great time slaughtering raiders with it!  Crafting and Settlement building: This was an extremely polarizing reveal since Fallout is not known for its extensive crafting and settlement system, but I loved it, especially the crafting, as I said in the combat section it allowed me to specialize my play-style in combat, The settlement building was something I loved, but was poorly explained and kinda felt a little ham-fisted as buggy, but when you have an entire trade route and a capitalistic wasteland economic empire, its fucking amazing, and Im glad that it was in the game! Overall I really liked it, but needed a lot more polish.  Presentation: The game is very pretty at points, and definitely isnt a bad looking game, but what kills it is the engine, its dated and old, and I had multiple frame rate drops, crashes, and glitches, this engine fucking sucks and it need to be replaced after Fallout 76.  Music: A very enjoyable soundtrack, very atmospheric and engrossing, Inon Zur is a great composer!  Closing thoughts: This is a great game, but a bad RPG, you have very little control over your character and the dialogue system is pathetic, but I loved my time playing this game, but is disappointing in retrospect and the context of thee series, and if youre new to the Fallout franchise, just pick up New Vegas, its leagues better than 3 or 4. But in spite of that, I just had a great time playing the game, so its saved from my 7 and below scores.  Final Score: 8/10;9630;;Dialogue Major Glitches;;Crafting Combat Exploration Story (and the factions);c;38814;226427
3094;;Snake Eater- its very hard to make a video game.  Its even harder to make an innovative video game.  And on top of that, its nearly impossible to make a video game that has meaning, emotion, purpose, and poise.  A game that stands for something more than just the words and characters.  Rarely doss a game like that come along- and this is that game.  Everything about this game is amazing, no part of it feels half-assed or slopped together, no part of it is without purpose or place.  It absolutely excels in every aspect and is one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever made, and Hideo Kojima should rest upon the laurels of this singular achievement for the rest of his days.

The format of the game is similar (all individual mission based) and while I did think that the overarching story was very interesting and compelling, the start and stop nature of it kind of made it lack punch narrativeley.  Also some parts were WAY easy while others were OVERLY cheap- not a consistent difficulty.  And also some of the graphics seemed like a step down from MGS3, though I did really like the comic book like cut-scenes.  Overall, totally worth playing.  Score Breakdown  The Tale Story- 8 Pacing- 6 Characters- 8 Originality- 10 Linearity- 5 Length- 8 Epicness- 9  The Presentation Visuals- 8 Display- 9 Music- 8 Sound FX- 10  The Mechanics Ease of Use- 5 Innovation- 8 Replayability- 6  Metal Gear- this game was surprisingly difficult, at least for me.  The story is bare bones, the gameplay is either too forgiving or frustratingly complicated, so much of the finding of items and objectives are completely ambiguous, BUT the atmosphere and innovation of the game are remarkable.  A real mixed bag but a SOLID start to the stealth franchise Id say.  It gets better.

Overall, this was a truly impressive experience for such an old game.  Kojima is the man!

The story is a pandering bait and switch from the beginning whose story lacks punch because of a main character switch, the ACTUAL characters in the narrative are either whiny, pointless, or half-baked, and the messages in it are incredibly heavy handed on every single front.  The saving grace of this game is its gameplay and look being slick, though I also think that this could easily be the hardest MG game because the enemy placement and reaction times are so incredibly cheap.  Enjoyable to play?  Kind of.  Meaningful?  Not really.  At least you did better with MGS3 Kojima because this was not what anybody expected or honestly wanted.

3095;;Although this used to be my preferred game of the old mega man, now that Im older, I have to go back with the majority to say that MM2 is just a better made game, the difficulty is much tighter overall and far less cheap, the slide mechanic is iffy and for a game about mashing a particular button is unkind when trying to bash another. Those  red platforms are terrible as well.  To me, the music is slightly better than that of 2, probably why as a kid, who had trouble beating any robot master, I felt like this was the superior game.;1716;;;;;c;8607;228531

3098;;Castlevania is first entry of popular old-school platformer that still recognized today among gamers. This game what is definition of challenging and hardcore platformer in 8bit era. Playing as Vampire Hunter, you have to face against supernatural enemies by using whip as main weapon and obtainable skills alongside the side scrolling gameplay by whipping the enemies and also breakable items to get power to use skills.   If its something that is really notable for me in game play is how ridiculously this game when it comes enemy intelligence because every step they know what they are doing to screw you. Even though you have life bar, every time you get hit you automatically jump and this is problematic when you are playing in platformer because in some levels without floor you are easily die because one hit.    Every stages in Castlevania have its own boss to defeat, and there are more five levels to beat. Basically this is game can be finished in two hour, but considering how difficulty the enemies and platformer are, remember to take a break when you are stuck by keep dying. In order to finish the game, if you play this game today. Its kind of that rage-quit inducing game and you need more patience in order to learn unpredictable enemies movement. So play with emulator with regular saves during the gameplay because what I can say... this is the first entry of popular game that appeals to hardcore retro gamers.

3099;Throwing stuffs into zombies here is fun thing to do while you get chores from B-tier animation actors to do this and that.;Just played Dead Island Definitve Edition and finished the campaign mode. I am gonna review it on the web but here random thought about it:   The story line is basically about zombie outbreak in exotic island named Banoi Island where four immune survivor that consist of Kanye West, Sane Vaas Montenegro, Asian chick who know chemistry who work in the hotel as clerk but turns out she was a spy and last, that walking dead character who wields katana who were also ex-police are going to find a way to escape from the outbreak aftermath by doing errands for NPCs who are native people, good-samaritan, and that surprise ending character.  Its open world game where it has graphic with photo-realistic but shamefully, the characters animation are so lame with great voice acting. Imagine NPC characters cant act and have weird emotion, its like you watch B Movies. The quest are kind of chore where you can find it in many open world games but the thing that differentiates this game than other how satisfying using throw-able weapon instead fires random gun in order to defeat hordes of zombie and enhance / upgrade the weapon by crafting by taking stuffs and looting dead people stuff.   Story wise the game can be similar with many movies about zombie outbreak but this time happens in exotic island and you are as player is free to explore and have thrill in quite calm and relaxing stroll in killing zombies, finding various people and environment that consist of more than 10 chapters but somehow you can go back in forth between the area.  The elements of RPG in leveling and unlocking new skills and abilities, four playable characters, looting and crafting system are the good thing about the game. This is kind of game where you can compare with Far Cry 3. while in Far Cry 3 you are stuck in island full of pirates and mercenaries while helping local people to free them. Dead Island gives you various zombies as something to fight against beside little bit of people to fight or to help. Players need to prepare for more time to finish the campaign if they want to max the character stats, where 24 hours of my life being has been stuck on Banoi Island with various its stunning and well made locations like its city, slums, and jungle.

The addition of the charge buster doesnt feel fleshed out and the bosses are easily the worst thing about this game, either feeling like bullet sponges, or just terribly un-fun.

Every fast split second dissision marketing is the name and the trade of GRIP.  It offers a campaign with unlockable cars on a tier to tier increments. Unfortunately, this game missed its biggest opportunity to offer levels or game modes with trick jumps and complicated maneuvers. Other than that I have experienced glitches. The car can pass through walls and in some cases, the car can get stuck to areas that cant get out off. The glitches can be forgiven though, what cant get a pass is the collision physics, the car stops instantly on a head-on collision without as much of a bounce.;18452;;Wall glitches  Collision physics;;Good Graphics Good Car Control  Very immersive experience;c;40865;231270

The game makes you care for the characters and their fate. The main character is a blank slate and that could a good thing but it also takes away from the potential impact it could give. The game mechanics are relatively bare-bones and could be fleshed out farther. The graphics of the game although they are incredibly beautiful they are serviceable at best and could use farther refinement.

The content is lacking in creative input, and it feels like the game is a DLC of the previews Hitman game and not a stand-alone title. The graphics didnt change much but they are considerably heavier. The game itself consumes over 8GB of RAM, and if you want to play it with stable 60fps with a GTX 1060 in Full HD, you can get yourself ready to set the graphical settings to medium, or even low. Although the game is fun to play if you like spy sneaking genre. The game has smooth movement but lacks the newest in game mechanics and details.

Darksiders 3 does seem a bit lacking when compared to its series brethren, at least for those who come in with high expectations.  However, the game would have benefited from more risk-taking in areas where it chose to play it safe. Nevertheless, Fury’s story is one worth looking in too, especially for fans who are anxious to see how the next chapter of the four horsemen unfurls although the story can be uninspired at times. Combat and exploration deliver good, old-school fun and the levels are brimming with secrets although there is a lack of the feeling of exploration and wonder that the first two titles had nailed down. However, the story turns out rather shallow and most of the collectibles and upgrades are not nearly as motivating as in the first Darksiders game.;28380;;Terrible checkpoint system Dated Game Direction;;Good Story Fluid Controls  Good Puzzle segments;c;40865;233670
3122;;Gamecube version.  LoTR: the Return of the King is a solid action and hack n slash game following the events of the movie. The campaign is divided in three parts, where of you can choose to advance each path as you unlock levels. You gain experience and level up after you complete a level, and can then purchase skills with the points you have earned depending on how good your kills are.  The games difficulty is fair, but it ramps up quite a bit once you get past half way through. Although mastering the different bane skills each character has will make it a lot easier to progress. Overall, the maps are nicely designed, the graphics are pleasent and have aged rather well, though there are some performance hits on the last level.  Once the campaign is complete, you can re-play all the levels with any character, and naturally it will be a lot harder playing the hobbits on non-hobbit levels since they deal less damage, and their attack combos are not as quick. I strongly recommend this to any LoTR fan, or just anyone who likes easy to pick-up action games.;2973;;- Pelennor Fields is a bastard of a level if you do not know what to do. - Said level is also extra difficult with hobbits, as they have the weakest projectiles.;;- A Good recreation of the movie with your expected LoTR musical score. - Combat is fluid. - Gandalf is awsome to play as. - Replaying the levels with other characters are pretty fun.;c;39973;231629

3127;;For a game that is still active today since 2008, Point Blank is what generic shooter with Pay2Win scheme as its finest which is popular among SEA gamers. Its constantly updated with new seasonal patch but not affecting nor improving the game play (even they change the name to be Point Blank Evolution in 2018) where the matchmaking system is updated into systemically following with current trend in FPS scene.   Interestingly, this game still can be run in any toaster PC with low-end graphic VGA card, the sounds in the game has been changed and updated like the music but not for audio dialouge and sound effect that is still sound same till today. The character design is too plain except players can pay for premium skins and also weapon that is game changing how bad this game because its so unbalanced and hence, it has dedicated strong and active player base who are mostly internet cafe patron. This game even have its own e-sports scene.  Point Blank is what you can get for free PC fps game that gives an alternative if players are too bored with Counter Strike 1.6 to play online against people who are divided into two kind of players. The poor who cant afford skins and premium weapons that add the stats, or the rich one who never heard any other FPS that is 1000 times better where they mostly rekt the poor one.;74859;;Pay2win;6;Can run on toaster Active player base Free;Pay2Win Alternative Cheap FPS Game;38235;231451

3130;;I never touch MOBA back when in college one decades ago but playing some retro games or anything FPS games that can ran on my toaster PC, It was my friend who introduced me this game where I can get free CD copy of the game from regional publisher where new users can request the game, so its kind of something historical for something I can see the physical release. So he said this game was must to try for PC gamers where comparing today, MOBA like this are popular on smartphone nowadays but not I remember the game fot the first time was released and available on my country.   And here my honest review for this game, its one of biggest MOBA arena that you can pick other than DOTA where I was not impressed by the game appeal and gameplay. LoL is what more casual MOBA with interesting aspects why you should like the game appeal for PC gamers who want to get into team-based game with unique skill for each champions you can pick where this game has more 100 characters and still added frequently.   Each character have particular role like Damage, Healer and Tank where players can pick what kind of role they want to play the game in order to win in a match where 5 players battle against bot or taking competitive match against another random players. The game is simple to understand but hard to master in order understanding how the game should be played, all you have to do killing minion bot to grind your champ in order to get stronger, crushing three layers of tower and in the end must destroying the enemy crystal base. This game takes 10 to 40 minutes of each session, starting with slow pace and turns into fast pace decision making when each players have higher level to start attacking enemy base.   LoL have the charm as popular MOBA where the characters are based on various form of weapons and skill. You can pick melee weapon wielding, gun shooting, or magic summoning which each characters have their own skills to master. These characters represent two side of faction where they have to battle in an arena where they have their own purpose based on their backstory but not really have too much influence on the game because they dont have particular quest.   In general, LoL have the most active player base on the world and the developer still update the game with various events and new skins where you have to pay but still its free to play. There are also competitive matches where its one of biggest e-sport game pick as tournaments. LoL is what candy toward casual PC gamers, it has polished gimmick for its characters like making special skins based on various theme like metal bands, idol groups, or so on.  For the closing, this game has no end and basically can be played as casual game, remember if you want to be competitive in this game. Spare you life.;115;;Easy to play hard to master;6;Free to play Have nice gimmicks Popular player base;A Candy for Casual MOBA PC Gamers;38235;220340

3132;;This game was pretty, it had some charm to it. But holy moly this one was on thin ice for me.  I played the entire reboot trilogy of Tomb Raider and this one wasnt it, it dragged along even after the fake outs of the ending multiple times. And the progression system felt so underwhelming it feels like you could literally play the game with having maybe 3 or 5 perks. The combat still suffers from awkwardness and enemies not reacting to bullets the way they should - for example when I shot an enemy with my shotty point blank no armor he simply flinched and took cover.  Not to mention the game had a ton of frame dips, weird texture pop-ins, the audio would become outta sync and the boat keeps going.   Now I cant completely tear this game to shreds and I wont because although this may be my least favorite outta the 3 I do have to say what I enjoyed the most was the immersion, I enjoyed the tombs and exploring looking for stuff to craft. Not to mention the throwback suits you get into the game are really nostalgic and funny. The platforming felt 30x better with Laura still flying through the air like a plastic bag during a tornado she does have a bit more weight on her so dont expect the plastic bag to fly too much now.   My closing statement is the game couldve used some work, the story couldve been tweaked a little bit there are some things that totally had me like wait, how? But thats okay, I would love to see more Tomb Raider or Laura Croft maybe soon. But now I gotta say this game is kind of a sleeper rn. Wait for a price drop of like $25 or even $30 if youre eager.;37777;;-Story gets bland really quickly -Combat hardly makes sense  -Rank System was pointless for the most part;;+Graphically stunning (when not stuttering) +Laura is still waifu for laifu  +Set pieces still rock.;c;40786;234363
3133;;A disservice to history. Intentional sabotage of uniforms and equipment, just out of fear for being bashed for making Nazis look cool or whatever (then why make a WWII game at all?)...   One of the most disrespectful things Ive ever seen in entertainment, is to be found in this game  the act of replacing the eight Norwegian soldiers (under British control) with a local Norwegian daughter and mother. That is just beyond me. Operation Gunnerside was a unique operation during WWII, being one of the few notable things happening in Norway during the war, and being a strong symbol of resistance and the willpower of an oppressed people (despite the fact that it turned out the Germans were far away from making a nuclear bomb, and the operation didnt make much of a difference). These eight men put their lives on the line, contributing to the effort of making us free and being able to, for instance, sit here and write reviews on IGDB. Some films were made, and thats great. But now that gaming finally has started to become a generally accepted form of entertainment (also increasing insanely in worth, being a BILLION dollar business), I find it truly sad to see things like this happening...  I have been waiting for a triple-A video game for ten years now. We only got two (CoD: WWII & Battlefield V) - and neither of the developers had the guts to make a true WWII-shooter. I loved the previous WWII-game produced by a triple-A company (CoD: WaW), but I would truly love to see one with great graphics and attention to detail. WaW was filled with mistakes, but they can be excused by the budget and limited technology of 2008 and before. Now EA has the best mechanics (at least in my opinion, I love the feel of their games), the best graphics (argueably) and they DO have the budget. They had the chance of a decade to nail down every little detail of the war, to make the game of possibly the decade. But instead they turned their back to their customers, fans and to those interested in history (espeically WWII).  A few things to mention in regards of the details:  - In Battlefield 1, the Germans wear Field Gray uniforms made out of mostly wool. They NAILED it, in regards to the look, the shininess, the way it looks when its wet, etc.. The Germans kept on using this material for their uniforms in WWII - yet the developers at EA/DICE decided to trash the previous excellent work and make the Germans wear some strange-looking blue-gray ish shirt-like material (not even with the right design). This is a great example of the sabotage done, as they already had someone make the perfect material (I believe thats quite a job, wool is not easiest material to make digitally/graphically), yet they trashed it (for no other reason I can think of, than to piss *ff geeks like me, who pay attention to details).  - Arguably, the most iconic part of the German uniform is the infamous Stahlhelm (steel helmet). Once again, to avoid backlash by radically-left media (for having NAZI ITEMS in a popular media), they decided to use the Hungarian M38 helmet - which is fairly similar, but very different at the same time. The strange things about this, is that as a helmet collector, I can tell you that the Hungarian helmet is rare to come across (at all), compared to the German one. For every Hungarian helmet I come across (online, in antique shops, etc), I come across 40+ German ones (due to ~25M German helmets being made during the war, compared to >50K Hungarian ones). So why in the world would they choose to put a Hungarian one in the game, when German ones are SO much easier to find and make a 3D-model out of? And no, Germans did not wear Hungarian helmets - at least not in enough numbers to make every God d*mn helmet in this game like that.  - A complete disregard to the course of the war. Almost all the Germans seem to be wearing camouflage. That would be fair enough for an ~April 1945 based game, not for Norway in 1940 (many of these camouflages didnt even EXIST by that time). You can see Tiger I tanks in Norway during 1940, and in Libya during 1941 - even though, funnily enough, the first Tiger I was deployed in the very end of 1942... And as a cherry on the top  the German Tiger I in Norway has desert camouflage - despite being in snowy Norwegian mountains/fjords (just like Germans were idiots, which they definitely were not).  - The Germans were known for having quite some insignia on their uniforms - yet near none of this is to be seen in the game. You have stupid twists like an Iron Cross medal on the German visor cap, even though the Iron Cross were ONLY seen below the neck or on the left chest, during the war. Who the f*ck puts medals on their hat, either way!? I saw some random multiplayer characters showing a great mix (and a great f*ck up, in regards of history) in someones gameplay. It was an enlisted soldier (one of the four bottom ranks, based on the shoulder boards), he was in the artillery (based on lining on the hat), he had a dyed-blue WWI camouflage on his tunic (pure fantasy, did not exist during the war), with a generals cord on his visor cap (despite being an enlisted private), of all the equipment he didnt wear, he had his mess tin (the tool you can drink from and cook food in) strapped to the front of his chest (random as F*CK, couldnt he have a roll of toilet paper as well?), etc., etc., etc....  To the people who say that people like me just are afraid of women in games, and minorities - then how come no other of the previous shooters faced a backlash like this? Its because this is set in a historical setting. Thats why. You can look on for hours and hours, and find one woman there, one black guy there, etc - but whats the point when tens millions of white men fought and died in this conflict? And if you find those single persons out of millions more important than the majority - then why dont you focus on that? For instance, lots of minorities fought for the Germans, despite common belief. Just look up a GREAT Facebook page called Foreign Volunteers of the Wehrmacht (the title is wrong, as its the Wehrmacht and the SS, but whatever). Youll be surprised to see Eurasians, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Indians, Slavs, etc fighting for Germany (voluntarily). It would have been truly awesome and eye-opening for people to play as these. And before you call me a neo-nazi or something like that - I hate Nazism, racism, Communism, Capitalism, and all radicalism equally. I dont want Nazi Germany to be put in a positive light, but I would like to see more about the average German soldiers  because they were just like you and me, after all.  To conclude, I hate this game, as this would have been my favorite game for decades - had it not been for this ridiculous revision of history. It COULD have been so good, so very, very good... I guess Im just extremely disappointed and frustrated, as others game companies now thinks that WWII is a risky setting (as they think the games sold bad due to the setting, not the execution) - and Ill have to wait another decade for a worthy WWII-game (unless they f*ck those ones up as well, it wouldnt surprise me, to be honest)...;83728;;Intentional misinformation about history Intentional lack of details Replacement of historical men;;Nothing, the whole revisionist setting depresses me;c;41476;234501

3136;;The Tales of series has been on my list of shame for a long while. I always felt Ive done it all (almost) JRPG-wise with all the Final Fantsies, Suikodens, Saga Frontier, Ni No Kunis etc. A lof of those games could learn story telling from Berseria. The plot is great, the characters charming (thanks to the great VO and writing) and you end up really caring for them. It helps if youre a fan of anime. On top of that the game has practically ZERO BUGS. The only issue I had was with the lack of camera control while on the hover board and the battle system takes some getting used to but once you do... oh man... its like youre at the arcade again smashing up foes with a huge banana smile on your face. I really liked the skill learning mechanics too and I always felt compelled to check my gear for new skills and not just slap on the newly found one. The dismantling and enhancing was also interesting as you need to make note of who learned what already and how many hard-to-come-by fragments or scraps youve go to use. Another great thing is how they solved the fast travel system. While you can use potions to warp to other areas, they also introduced a hover board which is loads of fun. It basically turns the dungeons you already visited into snowboarding arenas. Gathering Katz Balls at higher speeds is also satisfying and adds a bit of extra challenge when revisiting areas. Now for some cons - there is a bit of back tracking in the game and I feel like certain areas could be made smaller (especially Innominats domain) which is a great dungeon except for the distances you need to walk. The music is also stellar (especially the heavy Titania theme which made me think of early album Dream Theater riffs. Some of the songs that use strings and more classical instruments sound like they used VST plugins for that (which is fine) as they still hold up good. Theres a vast array of interesting melodies in the OST and after spending 10s of hours in the game, some of the more melancholic ones can really move you. Theres loads of great comedy in the game too especially thanks to the perfectly acted Magilou character. Cheers to the acress who lended her voice. Brilliant Performance. I wish I wasnt putting of playing this game for as long as I did. I talked to a lot of my friends and they seem to be doing the same thing. Berseria seems to be on the radar of maaaaany RPG fans that for various reasons decide to pick up a different title instead. Im here to tell you to make the plunge and get into it. OH and dont play the demo before hand. The combat system will just seem confusing. Better to watch the first hour of gameplay on YT instead. Thats what got me convinced to buy the game. OH,,, almost forgot! The games pacing is fantastic possibly due to the fact that the story is not watered down by a plethora of side quests. Those actually are few and pop up only by the end to wrap up really interesting plot lines that have been present throughout the game so youre automatically interested!;18812;;- Somewhat simplisitc graphics - Kamoanas voice - They could have included more  Anime cinematics;;- Story - Lovable Characters - Comedy - Music - Board travel system - Anime Cinematics - Voice Acting - Magilou - Skill System - bug-free (which is rare nowadays) - approach to side-quests;c;36424;234678
3137;;Its very rare these days that game devs come up with something absolutely NEW. This luckily has happened with Snake Pass. Trust me when I say that every game developer should play this game (kudos SUMO Digital) just to see how interesting controls can be. The idea was great and executed perfectly. Controlling Noodle is a challenge but it definitely gets easier over time and you get loads of satisfaction when you manage to beat an obstacle or collect a coin.  The difficulty of every subsequent level is very well thoughtout. The throphies are all doable but reaquire skill. The level environments are pleasant to just be in with lovely music to accompany the cartoonish graphics. The music is great and never annoying (me and my wife actually always ended up humming the melodies after playing). The game is bug-free which is a huge plus. Loved every moment of it and would definitely recommend it to anyone bored with the hundreds of reskinned games in the same genres coming out every day.;19220;;Thinking... nope... none.

3139;;In my opinion as a veteran battlefield player, battlefield has had their best times and their worst moments. Overall, I would say that the campaign is informational on things I never found out in WW2 history. The multiplayer is smooth (if you have a great system to play on). In rebuttal of Heinrichs negativity review, EA does not want copyright infringement first of all. Second, this a review not an opinion whereas what you hate or love. Third, there is no need to have the nazi signs where it can offend people and/or the media when it comes to this making a WW2 game that contains nazi germany. Last, why write a negative review on a game that did not finish their campaign yet. After all, I  would say that EA has more improvements/fixes in their game that would make the game more enjoyable for years to come.;83728;;I didnt like the negative reviews that people waste their time typing about how bad this game is in a full blown essay style;;campaign;c;38077;234911

3141;;As a SMT fan, this game is fantastic in many aspects: is tough as hell, is really demanding, but rewarding once you have found your strategy, visually is stunning for a 3DS games ay some points and the story is interesting. However some of this points can be as well really bad aspects of the same: some designs feel really lazy, repeating assets specially in NPCs characters (they don´t even have animation, it could have been another sprite an that´s it), as many Megaten games, are not really obvious on how to proceed so you may need to use a guide, specially to go through the map (I have one next to me everytime I was playing), some important aspects of the game are hide behind obtuse obstacles not that easy to find out, specially if you are going after the good ending (neutral in this case), which in my case I got it as pure chance...It is said that this is a good point to enter the franchise and that statement make sense, but even me loving more difficult ones like Strange Journey before playing this one, I had a hard time grasping the good points of the game.;6886;;;;;c;21796;235089
3142;;Hate to have to describe a game as educational as it usually evokes thoughts of poor attempts at gaming from old CD-ROM games in school computer classes, but this game was a nice introduction to the culture of native Alaskan culture and left me a sense of personal growth and new knowledge in others culture. The game includes short interview sections as extras that help to flesh out the games style and environment while not being too intrusive or like it is mandatory to take in. Some of platforming can be clunky and imperfect, but the option for a second player to take control of your companion to assist is a nice one.;7618;;;;;c;29411;235102
3143;;A game that is stylish and so ugly all at once. The setting and characters of 1980s Russia and following a band of Roma gypsies is certainly a unique one that works for its scratchy pixelated 80s Cold War aesthetic. But, man, does it revel in its griminess and depravity. I applaud its efforts in embracing this aspect, but the gameplay isnt a perfect execution as connecting hits in this beatem-up isnt a perfectly smooth experience. And maybe its trying to channel the ultra hard difficult games of the 8-bit era, but having a challenging experience while playing on Easy makes me scared to ramp up the difficulty in this game any higher. There are moments the game will fill the screen with enemies that I couldnt imagine having to take out even on Normal. Still, the overall feel of everything is a nice continuance of what Devolver Digital has been publishing and I keep looking forward to the chances they take in putting out the really off-the-wall stuff.;6655;;;;;c;29411;235103
3144;;With the bevy of Neo Geo games being re-released on Nintendos eShop, I downloaded this on the recommendation of the Giant Bombcast and it is so much fun when you get the rules down. It isnt your typical puzzler and can take a little more thought when breaking down the different denominations of money and quickly strategizing your way to victory. The appearance and music is very charming and maintains the arcade feel. The only trouble I had was mapping the controls out between two joy cons and figuring all that out. Otherwise, it makes for a great two-player vs. mode.;37280;;;;;c;29411;235195
3145;;I pre-ordered Just Cause 4 and eagerly waited several days to be able to play it. Because I bought the Gold Edition, I got to play it 7pm (Cincinnati time) Sunday night, while it released worldwide Tuesday.  My history with Just Cause is that I started playing JC3 February 2017. For years Id seen it when Id search for Just Dance (which Ive been a fan of since 2014), so I was always aware of it. But I didnt care about it until The Gaming Lemon made a funtage over it. I immediately added it to my Gamefly Q. I fell in love with the game in a similar way I did with Assassins Creed: Odyssey. I even bought all of the DLCs. Like I did with Odyssey. Thats why I bought the Gold Edition. I bought Just Cause 2 on sale earlier this year, but Im that one weirdo who doesnt like it.  So when I actually hesitated slightly when it came to pre-ordering Just Cause 4. I was afraid that JC3 would be an anomaly in the series, that Id like just that one. And at first I thought thatd be the case. One of my favourite things about the third one is blowing up bases. They technically removed that here. You can still blow up stuff in bases, but theres no list of things in each one to go through. It doesnt feel as satisfying, because you blow up a ton of stuff in a base, and all it does is add you your overall Chaos Meter. At first this was a negative to me, and it still kind of is. Its still satisfying blowing stuff up, but not as much.  The number one thing I see people complaining about is the graphics. It doesnt look like an N64 game like I see so many people saying. There are times when the shadows dance around, and sometimes it looks like the pixels on the ground are alive trying to push past each other. But I honestly dont notice it unless I deliberately look for it. When Im wingsuitting around or doing actiony stuff, I dont notice it. Graphically, my only issue was the tornado itself. The trailers made it look like this epic dark ominous figure with a life of its own. Its actually all white except for the very bottom, and I barely even realise its there unless I wingsuit high enough to see it. But thats the only thing I dont like about the tornado. The physics around it are really cool.  Im playing on my Xbox One S, and there was a moment when the tornado was going through a large base, blowing up a ton of stuff, and the game started lagging really bad as though the console couldnt handle that much stuff going on at once. I dont think thats ever happened before, in this or any other game.  Story-wise, there doesnt seem to be a main story. Theres a bunch of main-side quests, and each of them further the story in some way. Its an interesting way of doing it, basically do the story your own way. I can still follow whats going on, so its not like that makes things confusing. Im just used to there being a main story questline. There are still the side quests that have to help people or take out this Black Hand person and such.  I really like the new gadgets. The balloons are very useful. When I saw them in the gameplay trailers, I was thinking they were a useless addition, but I use them more than I was excepting I would. Same with the boosters. Its fun combining the two. Turn anything into a floating rocket.  Theres both more destruction and less destruction in this game. In JC3, you could blow up any bridge. In this one, I have yet to do that. Ive tried. But pretty much anything else can be destroyed. When Im driving any vehicle, the only thing that stops me are mountains and certain buildings. Trees and rocks get destroyed by vehicles. I dont remember if that was a thing is JC3 because I hated driving in that game. This one still has awful driving. Which I was hoping theyd fix since they did Mad Max and that one had great driving, but they were probably hoping everyone would wingsuit around the map....so why put so much emphasis on how many vehicles are in the game? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  One thing I didnt like at first but am starting to really like is how you take over territories. In JC3, you do it by blowing up bases. Do every base in a territory and you take control of that area. In JC4, You do a mission or two in a area, and when you fill up the Chaos Meter you get more rebel squads, allowing you to push the front line further. It was an annoying mechanic at first, but Im starting to like it the more I play it.  Overall, its not better than JC3, but its still a great game. I am very much enjoying this game, and it doesnt have to be better than the previous one to be a good game. If you havent played it yet, I do highly recommend it.;103261;;Weird graphics at certain points Bad tornado graphics Feels like an overall downgrade from previous title;;Cool new gadgets Tornado physics More Just Cause!;c;37707;235248
3146;;One of the better FMV games Ive played, which isnt a whole lot, but they usually come with an awkward reputation. This game is executed in way where I felt that the story and atmosphere was fascinating and engaging enough but the gaming aspects got in the way of everything. There were some confusing game-ending moments that made it frustrating to play over mostly because the selection cursor was too slow or at the wrong part of the screen.

The only thing that holds this back from being a 10 for me is that the graphics DO NOT hold up and some of the voice acting is a bit hammy, but regardless, so much else about this game is beyond measure in terms of its impact and importance for the evolution of gaming in general that it deserves every single accolade thrown at it and then some.

3153;;I really liked the realism, music and the overall atmosphere of this game but the amount of bugs made me quit after having completed about 50% of the main storyline. It wouldnt have been so bad if there was a quick-save option, but now, if youre unlucky, you can be set back several hours if a bug (like falling through the ground or getting stuck in a tree etc. etc.) suddenly strikes. Happened to me several times.;4843;;Lots of bugs Annoying save-system Conversation options are unpredictable;;Atmosphere Realism Music Very large open-world Educative;c;41654;236583
3154;;As an end to the Metal Gear saga, it serves the franchise nicely with pretty much tying up every loose end possible, albeit sometimes in a little ham-fisted or possibly not 100% cogent or thought out way.  But, regardless of the overwhelming fan-service, it manages to be extremely enjoyable the entire time.  The graphics are some of the best on the PS3 and the scenarios are updated to give a taste of the majority of what came before it boxed up in a polished and slick game.  At times, it almost felt too easy with the plethora of gadgets and weapons constantly available, but that didnt diminish the fun had since there were many options for getting through each area.  Ended up being probably the most accessible MGS there ever was, and a fitting finale for Snake and the gang.  Will say, it got a little too long with the cutscenes though- like watching an entire movie sometimes!

3156;;Based on N64 version  Overall, a pretty mixed experience.  Lots of the game are flat out cheap in terms of their difficulty, but other sections you can walk right through so inconsistent to gauge correctly.  The graphics are decent for an N64 near-launch title, the music is repetative but better than some, and the sounds are pretty authentic.  Like that there are many different types of game styles mixed in so it doesnt just fall into one genre.  In the end, frustrating but kind of fun.

3157;;Gris is a beautiful game that offers a very poignant experience. It plays so smoothly, while the beauty of the world around you comes into frame just as well. Gris is incredibly reminiscent of another game, Journey. Reminiscent in all the right ways. Where it separates itself is in the themes and sometimes the tones of the emotional journey your character is going through. The game plays similarly, while also being very distinct.  One huge success for this game is its level design. The levels flow so well, that you dont get lost, you dont hit dead ends. Many times its so easy flowing that you wonder if youre going the right way. Some of the levels even reuse areas youve been to, but youve got a new perspective so you can now access areas you didnt even know were there before. The level design doesnt forcefully push the player in directions, it simply leaves a path for the player to follow, while not being too simple.   While it is as incredible as it is. This isnt a difficult game. Youd have to be in the right mood, or be someone who enjoys a sort of spiritually/emotionally poignant experience that this gives. Its nothing new as far as mechanics go, even though theyre so well implemented. This game is here to be beautiful, and thats all thats needed here, and it succeeds in my opinion.   The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the music pushes this game further in an incredible way as well. I cant recommend this game enough.;22917;;If youre looking for a difficult game, this wont be it.

3160;;In Asteroids, you avoid (or shoot) asteroids and shoot UFOs spawning from left or right. As all arcade games from the time, there is no way to complete Asteroids. The  main goal is to get a good ranking on the highscore list.  There are a few ways to do this, but still, its possible to do it in more than one way.  On one hand you can avoid the asteroids and wait for the UFOs to show up, for a more patient gameplay, picking higher scores on one-shots. On the other hand you can go out guns blazing and try to beat level after level.  Asteroids is An innovative game for the time being, where youre not stuck with your spacecraft at the bottom of the screen.;7758;;The game is really repetative;;Asteroids opens up different styles and tactics of gameplay;c;41808;237894

3162;;Hangman, as it already is with pen and paper, is a boring game where you pick letters to either be placed in a word or missing out. If you pick wrong letters the man gets closer to being hanged.

That way, Hangman actually can be fun.;17259;;Its really boring. Like really.;;;c;41808;237908
3163;;If youre a retro gamer, or interested in the history of gaming, I would say this is something to check out. Atari Vault is a bundle of about 100 games for arcade and the Atari 2600. The games are, as you can expect, ugly. But what games from the bottom of our gaming history is not ugly? Some of the games in this bundle are worth gold. The games are as they should, as they were.  Through a worldwide high score board you can see how awesome you are (or how much you suck) compared to all other players with Atari Vault installed.

3164;;Missile Command is worth trying out because it might be one of the most dystopic games ever. Its said that during the development, programmer Dave Theurer suffered from nightmares where six cities in California was bombed by enemy missiles.   Age of the game was during the cold war, and its not a coincident that most part of early games had an invaderish theme. Missile Command is the most obvious example of how games reflect our history, culture and everyday life.  There is no winner in Missile Command. The goal of the game is to try to hang in there for as long as possible before the end. The game over screen says it best. It doesn,t say Game Over. It actually says The End. In that sense Missile Command really is a depressive experience, still well worth trying out.  A note is that its also said that programmer Dave Theurers nightmares stopped after the game was published.;12313;;Its really, really depressing;;Its intense in a good way;c;41808;237934
3165;;This game really lacks when it comes to control and gameplay, but there is no turning around the impressing early vector graphics. Tempest is worth checking out only for that reason, and mostly, my high rating is more or less based on only that. The graphics.   The gameplay is also okay, as soon as you learn the stiff control.;15383;;Stiff control;;Impressive early age graphics;c;41808;237950
3166;;This is a game thats supposed to be a classic, and Im sure it is. But I cant get passed the relief of living in a time with a lot less white noise in games. Im also glad that theres no need to but my head in a manual that doesnt give a clue of how to really play the game.  Ive played it far too long, even passed the first wave of vomit in my mouth. You know, the one that hits you at the same time as all few colors of 1981 melts together in one flashing screen?;9757;;This is just an awful game;;;c;41808;237954
3167;;As a kid I thought this was one of the most boring titles to the NES. But as I one day found myself being an adult, I suddenly started to enjoy the game.   No. Actually, it has almost nothing to do with being older. Its just that Ive played a few tennis games over the years, and after that went back to this game. The control is really simple and tight. The curve of learning is short, but it possibly takes a lifetime to master, and thats, in my book, good mechanics.  One flaw is that theres no one on one mode for whipping a friend, even though theres examples of vs. tennis-modes earlier in gaming history. So on Nintendos part, theres no excuse to not have a vs. mode in this game.  But still. Tennis is in my opinion the best sports game when it comes to NES black box games.;20461;;Theres no vs. mode;;The control is really simple, but still hard to master;c;41808;237961
3168;;Look, I really understand the impact of Donkey Kong, and I also know its a classic beyond classics. But I really dont care.  I hate this game.  There. I said it. Put yourself in my shoes. I was a sniffling little poor boy, waiting for my parents to come home with the games they rented for the weekend (yeah, you could do that back in the day, you know). You were hoping for Super Mario Bros. but instead you got this pile of garbage with a stupid fat monkey on the cover.  And why?  Because your parents saw that Mario dude on the cover with a cool hammer. Well, mom and dad: heres my mid finger pointing at you from an adult perspective back to my childhood. Thanks a lot for spoiling my weekend, to the point where I actually started to look forward to school on monday.  I never saw the brilliance with Donkey Kong, but it might be because I missed the hype.;1086;;Its a really boring game;;Mario was born with this game, and so was Donkey Kong;c;41808;237963
3169;;Ive never liked Donkey Kong, and I know its a bit of a controverse to mention that.  But as progression of games for NES, this is really an interesting title. In this game you play as Donkey Kongs son, trying to save him from the evil guard holding the keyes. And the evil guard is Mario! Yes. There is a game where sweet Mario is put as antagonist.  Look at the screenshots! See how tight that cage with Donkey Kong is? Mario is really cruel. And not just that! Mario is trying to kill a baby monkey in diapers! Isnt that making you sick to the stomach?  More seriously though. The gameplay reminds of the gameplay in its precursor, You play as Donkey Kongs spawn, trying to save his father by getting the key at the end of the one screen platform stage. In this game you also find platforms and, may I call it water effects(?), thats later shown in Super Mario Bros.;1087;;Theres really nothing new when it comes to gameplay;;Interesting mix of characters;c;41808;237965
3170;;This review is for the NES port  Xevious is the game your older brother brought home saying Its time to throw that fuzzy Mario dude out of the console, because Ive got an awesome action-packed game where you shoot stuff and you had to step aside with tears in your eyes as your tough brother did just that.  Xevious is a shooter filled with action, and it couldve been awesome if it was more packed with power ups, but sadly the gameplay becomes boring before you get through the first level.   Playing Xevious youll find yourself long for that fuzzy Mario game you were playing before.;12346;;Repetetive gameplay.;;If you really, really dont find any other shooter and you just have to shoot stuff, this might still do the trick.

3172;;Concept of this game is great, but in this first version of Bomberman (that I know of), the gameplay is a bit slow because the playground is too big, scrollingng one screen.   The goal for each level is to bomb all enemies so that Bomberman can keep on to next level through a door (that apears behind a bombed block). The door is only accecible once every enemy is blasted. Every level takes time, and might be fun if youre in to a long run with the game.  Point is that Bomberman is not worth keep playing even though theres limitless continues. All power ups are lost when Bomberman dies, which means youll face harder enemies and trickier levels from scratch.  But Bomberman might still be worth playing if you do it in one sitting. With one life.;3445;;It takes too long getting somewhere;;Good concept, that will flourish to some awesome games in the future of this series.;c;41808;239418

3179;;I believe with the Smash Brothers series you have its ups and its down, (Smash 4.)  Its been 10 years since Ive enjoyed a Smash Brothers game with that being Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. For me a game can easily and quickly rope me in by having a beautiful story, deep meaning, and good gameplay and a lot of games I play most of the time miss the mark. Brawls Subspace mode was special to me and already played Melee and the 64 version of the game I was blown away- I never played anything like Brawl before. So, not to go into detail about Brawl since this is an Ultimate review Ill make it short.  Brawl opened a door for me in story telling that I never thought Id actually love. Me being 9 years old when playing the game I wasnt aware that these Nintendo faces had a bigger and badder threat looming over them, this threat is Tabuu. Since then I have always told myself Brawl will always be special to me for making me invested in this world. For Example seeing Ness and Lucas on the same screen interacting with each other was something bonkers for me. Mainly because as a lot of people whos had one conversation with me knows Earthbound is my all time favorite game. So seeing Nintendo acknowledge these legends was something I wouldve never expected in my wildest dreams.  Continuing forth with Smash 4 (ahahaha, see?) I did not like Smash 4.   Now Ultimate - the game Ive waited 10 years for, a game that upon announcement made me do something that hadnt happened since the announcement of God of War (2018.) And that was scream so loud I literally strained my vocal chords and I was unable to speak at a certain volume for a few days. Now honestly I shouldnt have screamed becasue in the back of my mind I thought  itll probably be just another Smash 4 where a lot of the game isnt my tea and I still wont see Ice Climbers. I was wrong. Watching every Official Nintendo Announcement regarding Ultimate was life changing every time and with the success of the Nintendo Switch its a game I had high hopes for.   Lets start off with the game itself, how it feels, how it plays. The game is fast paced, this isnt anything new for the series at all. But when you go from Brawl to Ultimate you feel a bit more grounded feel. Where characters instead of being floaty and light. Almost feel and play like they look. For example, the first thing I did when booting up the game was go to Classic mode and play captain falcon. He is this really thin character with quick movements and fast and fluid punches.  Before the release of Smash Ultimate I did play Smash 4 to get a feel on what I missed out on and quickly switching from Smash 4 to Smash 5 (6 since Sakruai considers Smash wii u and Smash 3ds to be different games, theres your fun fact of the day) it was not a drastic change and I learned things primarily by testing what worked in Smash 4 and what works in this installment. Which youd be surprised is a lot. I wont lie Im not a big vocab user and at the end of the day I am just a guy with a nose.   Moving forward  on with Adventure mode  spirits. A mode that for me felt like it wasnt as great as Subspace but I do feel tone they were going for. After running about 30+ hours in the Adventure mode I could appreciate the many fights it gives you the fact that a lot of fights are never the same and will either be a finger tearing challenge or a walk in the park.  It is pretty much after the first areas what you see is what you get. There is New Game Plus after you beat the main story, which i havent started admittedly but the Spirits will keep you invested in the Adventure mode with different approaches to each fight.   Online mode is Online. Nothing has really changed if one of the players you play even has the thought of going into a 3 bar connection it will tank and you will be mashing hoping itll let go soon. Its also really bare when it comes to its features online, there isnt much of a co-op online. like why cant I play Smashdown Online? Why? Thatll be amazing literally amazing. Or why cant I run classic online? Atleast with a friend?? Options like these have an easy work around with using things like Parsec (which Im trying to figure that out still.)  Moving forward Online would be a miss if it wasnt one of the main focuses of the game.  Smash - core modes, everything is the same with the exception of Smashdown and the new and improved Custom Battle mode. I never cared much for other modes but in Ultimate it feels almost as if was tweaked so you can throw yourself in almost in situation and find different solutions in and out of any battle. lets see, theres super sudden death mode which is absolutely insane and every moment of it makes me nervous and my heart pound with anxiety.   In conclusion Super Smash Brothers Ultimate takes something from each Smash game and builds upon that with love and care. Although I am critical of Smash for the Wii u/3DS I would have to thank it for being the successor and having good mechanics which are made better in this one. Sorry this took so long to make, sickness, personal family things and overall laziness I would recommend this game to newcomers and veterans. -12/22/2018 2 weeks after the game came out.;90101;;i have reached maximum ascendance.;;hey look, my children ice climbers are back!;c;40786;237682

3184;;Almost 30 years from its launch and Chrono Trigger is still the best game ever made. Lots of games even today fail into creating a game with any of the innovations and characteristics this game has.;1802;;- Graphics just playable for today. - Steam version has even worse graphics than the original. - A lot of limitations because of the age of the game (Almost no side missions  No impactful choices on the main history  No more things to explore  And so on).;;- Great music (Seriously. I Doubt that youll find a game where every music is outstanding. - Gameplay with a lot of inovations (Real time rpg. Skills with different sizes and formats. Enemies that move on the screen for more strategic skill usage. GROUP SKILLS. Etc) - Great story (The journey of a hero with travel an time. Normal citizens that get powers to save the world) - Well animated moves. - Amazing characters and interactions with each other (Every character that you choose for a mission will give DIFFERENT SPEECHS for the dialogues in the history);c;42031;240060
3185;;Danganronpa V3 is even better that the other games. And without a doubt one of my favorite games.;12579;;- Some weird characters that are impossible for us to relate with. - Free-time events arent that great. Even with good characters. - Bad final trial, for some people (Not me);;- Game more HUMAN (People dont start killing for nothing. They evade killing until the very last moment, when they have a deep motivation. This is different from the others game, that focus on building killing machines) - Amazing characters (Except for some paranoics, even the weird characters are deep and charismatic. Like Kokichi) - Good reflexions (Is the truth always a need? Is a good lie a way to find the truth?) - Impactful gameplay with lots of climaxes (The new mechanics and mini-games allows the trials to become much more emotional) - Genious final trial (Lots of plot-twists. Common in the Danganronpa series);c;42031;240102
3186;;A choices-matter game on a world of fables, where the fables we all know live peacefully.  Is that so? With a series of murders, the city slowly starts to reveal the filthy place it is.;2993;;- Not so impactul choices (Most of them only changes dialogues) - Bad background visuals (On my opinion, its ugly. Most of scenarios are grey and brown. And have some purple and blue lights) - Bad characters (I related to only some of them. Like big bad wolf and Snow. But most of citizens are evil, uninteresting and with a design to make us to hate them. Because the game wants to pass a filthy city impression);;-Great use of references (Every fable has a very different reality that the books. Happily even after becomes: Divorced independent woman. Rich becomes poor) - Great and unexpected history. - Emotional moments;c;42031;240103
3187;;There isnt much to comment about Valkyria Chronicles. Or you love or you hate it. The main focus of the game is the gameplay and the emotional history. And i have to admit, the game is hard but rewarding. Because every level you have to use a different strategy.;7477;;;;;c;42031;240104
3188;;Loved by ones, hated by others, Danganronpa is a great game that i evaded playing because of prejudice (Of a KUMA BEAR on a KILLING GAME).  But this game almost a battle royale. You have to kill a person to escape, but only if you can pass through a trial to discover who is the killer.;7842;;- Superficial and weird characters, that stand to their personalities (Except for some characters, like Naegi and Kirigiri, most of the characters dont have a deep background and are just a personality. Like Killer, Pervert, Follower of the rules, etc);;- Intelligent investigations and trials - History with lots of plot twists and emotional scenes.;c;42031;240106
3189;;The main focus of Xcom is the gameplay. The history, music, characters, ... Nothing else is so impactful. But thats not a problem. The game is challenging and has a lot of options of upgrades and classes for all tastes. For lovers of strategy, this is a must play!;1318;;;;;c;42031;240108
3190;;Even for me, a person who hates space fictions, Mass Effect 2 showed to be a great game with good characters and choices. The gameplay is awesome when you learn to use it correctly. You can use combos and use the quick skills hotkeys to see a lot of fight effects on your screen.;74;;- The forced exploration to advance history. I mean: Go there and find that thing, Find that guy, Talk to that person, Get all those things and bring to me, etc. - Lack of skills (You have only acess to 3 at a time. And your class only has abouy 5 at total).;;- Most characters are impactful and have a deep background.  - Lots of emotional moments, specially close to the final. - Involving history.;c;42031;240109
3191;;As a sequel to Chrono Trigger, this game is bad. As a separaretely game, Chrono Cross is a amazing. The history is good and there are a lot of characters.  And thats the point dont like on this game: The characters. It doesnt matter how many characters exist if every characters is weird, bad and superficial. The only good characters are a copy of some Chrono Trigger characters. The dialogues they contribute are so little and doesnt have any emotion on them.;1804;;;;;c;42031;240111
3192;;Final Fantasy X competes with FF VII about being the favorite Final Fantasy for most players.;418;;-The gameplay and the mini-games arent that great. You get bored in the first hours.  -Bad skill-tree (For me, that am a fan of rpgs, the lack of skills for each class was a bad point) -Lenght (The game could be shorter, since its combat becomes boring in the first half);;- Good, but not outstanding characters (Basically: Riku, Yuna and Tidus) - Amazing scenarios. Probably the first Final Fantasy with moving backgrounds (Specially water) - And the best point: Emotional Story-telling. This game fullfil us with so many emotions that its underwhelming. Theres romance, sadness, happiness, hate, proud, etc.;c;42031;240174

The story is decidedly dark and cryptic, but is contrasted by goofy side characters and sceanrios that totally clash with the sombre attitude of the main narrative.

Between every succesful mission (or failed once), a scoreboard is shown, keeping record of the war that unfolds in the gameplay.

3209;;(played on PS4) The additions made to Hitman 2 are solid improvements upon Hitman 2016, but I feel are ultimately not enough to satisfy those who werent already fans of the series. Its hard to not see this game as an expensive level pack rather than a true sequel, and while I think hardcore fans will enjoy it (I certainly did), I think many will find it rather disappointing or even lazy. Its unfortunate because a lot of people had very similar complaints about the amount of content in Hitman 2016, so seeing it carry over just makes me feel like its destined to be received badly. I can only really recommend this game to non-fans if you get the legacy pack with it, but it adds 20-30 dollars extra onto your purchase, which Im sure is a turn-off for a lot of people.  (note: the gold edition does NOT come with the legacy pack, but if you already own Hitman 2016 on the same platform you buy Hitman 2 on  you can redeem the legacy pack for free. You can find more info about that online, if you need);103210;;- Very little gameplay innovation, with plenty of gameplay issues from Hitman 2016 still present and a frustrating lack of common-sense mechanics. There are many actions in the game that would be helpful or make sense to be able to do, but you just cant. The most obvious one would be how youre now able to hide weapons and items within suitcases, but not disguises. (A suitcase that cant carry suits?) I understand that it could result in making the game much much easier, but I feel like this could of been counter-balanced by making it so bulkier disguises (like mascot outfits) cant be fit into the case, as well as having conditions that could ruin certain disguises  like getting wet/muddy while wearing a suit or killing someone with a knife and getting blood on your outfit. Maybe even some more comedic things like stepping in dogsh*t or hiding in a dumpster for too long and having the smell stick to you. - Saving and loading is very slow to do, a quicksave/quickload button on the pause menu would of been helpful. - Very sparse story with a cliffhanger ending  this isnt really a deal-breaker for a Hitman game, but its definitely still an issue worth mentioning. - Lower quality cinematic cutscenes. This isnt a huge problem, but considering the last game had fully animated ones it just seems a bit strange to switch to what are essentially dramatic slide-shows. - Expensive Season Pass. Maybe 40USD, I live in Australia so see for yourself. (its 60AUD here, though I got it with the gold edition.)  (platform specific) - (XBOX/PS4) - No way to change your controls in the options, except for basic sensitivity sliders. - (PS4) No platinum trophy on PS4  very strange not to have one, and as someone who likes getting achievements in games I find it pretty disappointing. - (XBOX/PS4) Ive had multiple crashes on PS4, and from what Ive seen online it seems to also be an issue on Xbox One. - (PC) Ive heard from many people that the PC version has some serious issues, especially with performance. I havent played it on PC so I cant say for sure, so make sure to do some research about it if you plan to buy it on PC. - (All) Many people have reported issues with obtaining the legacy pack, with different issues and solutions for different systems. I personally had an issue getting it on PS4, but it seemed to fix itself after restarting my console.;;+ 2 new game modes  Sniper Assassin and Ghost mode. Sniper Assassin is a fairly simple mode where the goal is to kill 18 targets in a level, completing challenges to boost your score multiplier. It can be played solo or with 1 other player. Ghost mode is similar to the Escalation mode from Hitman 2016, but now has another player in a separate game-world competing against you, with some ways you can sabotage each-other throughout the match. + Solid new levels with plenty of new and unique ways to assassinate your targets. + The legacy pack  a great idea Id like to see implemented in more sequels. + Vastly improved sound  Gunshots sound fantastic and NPCs now have location-appropriate accents. + New difficulty settings  Casual, Professional, and Master. + Loads of replay value  whether its discovering everything in a level or completing all the challenges and achievements, theres a lot to sink your teeth into if you enjoy that sort of thing. + Great sense of humor. A little subjective, yeah, but I think people who enjoy darker and irreverent deadpan humor will get a kick out of a lot of the dialogue and scenarios you can create. + Smooth gameplay.

3213;;I think its fair to say that Boxing is a pretty decent game considering its early entré in gaming history. Of course, Boxing is not a pretty game to rest your modern eye, but still it does the trick if boxing was what the gamer wanted.  Its two players beating ones up with blocky boxing gloves in bird view. Even with an early control like this, the gamer could use the tactics of defense or offense. Boxing is pure. Its boxing, straight up.

3217;Darksiders III is by no means mediocre in all aspects. It just has significant strengths compared to its predecessors like the characters and the writing but also very striking weaknesses like inconsistent and questionable hitboxes, mob and world design, obsolete puzzles and infuriating technical issues. Oh well, lets hope Strife delivers in Darksiders IV, he atleast looks damn cool...kind of like Beelzemon...copycats...again...;- The World -  While being significantly smaller in scale than Darksiders II, the world of Darksiders III feels as empty. You can backtrack to find weapon enhancements and hidden loot or fight optional bosses, but none of it really adds anything significant to the gameplay experience. Bar some exceptions, the world itself looks very similar to the one of the first game, hence feels uninspired and dull, not even managing to rekindle some of that Darksiders nostalgia when throwing enemies and environments from previous entries at you. At the same time I am glad, that Gunfire Games didnt try to create an illusion of a vast world and stuck with a very linear approach of progression through the levels, allowing you to stray from the path here and there but never far from it. Also the absence of sidequests is really healthy for the game, making you focus on the main storyline instead of running pointless errands or finding certain items in boring dungeons to gain irrelevant loot for it like in Darksiders II. The few puzzles you encounter are not worth mentioning, because they are easy to solve and add no real value, challenge or fun to the overall experience, which often left me a bit clueless as of why Gunfire Games put puzzles in Darksiders III in the first place, when they tried to reinvent the identity of the franchise anyway.   - Visuals and Performance -   The game itself looks decent at best and is very inconsistent in the quality of its visuals but never outstanding in any kind of way. Despite its average looks, the game has multiple technical issues like frame drops, long loading times and tearing. It freezes from time to time to load in necessary environment ahead of the player with textures still occasionally popping in out of nowhere. Only the very characteristic art direction of the game saves it here and there, leaning heavily towards the great work of Joe Madureira in the first 2 entries but not quite coming close to it in my opinion. Especially the regular mobs are forgettable, while most bosses have very fitting and nicely done designs.   - Controls -  The controls are tight and responsive and are one of the few solid aspects of the gameplay in Darksiders III. But they also have to be considering that you get less invulnerability frames dodging on higher difficulties, when it is your primary defensive tool in Darksiders III.   - Combat -  The problem with the combat trying to take from Souls and Bayonetta is that it does not have one major ingredient vital to Souls and Bayonettas combat system, precision. In Darksiders III you have huge, but also very inconsistent hitboxes all over the place with enemies jumping or sliding around, covering very wide areas with their attacks, which can get really messy. The boss fights is where the combat system can shine, atleast in relation to the rest of the game. It works inherently better in 1v1 scenarios than in combat against multiple enemies with its rather slow camera and the very stiff lock on system. You have to study and learn the patterns of a boss to effectively combat it and all the main bosses have a very unique and diverse movepool, making every boss fight different from the last one. The huge letdown here is, that Gunfire Games decided to copy one of the worst design choices ever from Dark Souls 2 and 3 in my opinion. You get conditioned into dodging immediately when fighting small mobs, but more powerful mobs or bosses always telegraph their attack, then delay it to bait your dodge, track your movement and then hit really hard. I know it was a counter meassure in the Souls games to give players a challenge again who mastered rolling and dodging in the first Dark Souls, but even then it just feels unnatural and tries to force a fake sense of difficulty onto the player. Conditioning someone just to break that conditioning again isnt well done combat design, it is really, really lazy. The additional weapons, new abilities and weapon enhancements you can find during the game open up a more versatile way of combat and enable you to approach combat the way you want to and craft your own personal combat style. That would have been a nice addition if the combat system itself wasnt so flawed at its core.   - Writing -  Darksiders III probably has the best written characters and dialogue in all three games, especially Fury and her Watcher have nice verbal exchanges and actual personalities, with Fury also having a maybe a bit rushed but nice character arc. Though one must not overlook some really, really corny or even cringeworthy oneliners or dialogue lines, particularly between bosses and Fury herself. The voice acting itself is a bit lackluster as well. Even the very same voice actors go from well done voice acting to completely overacting their lines, which falls in line with the rest of the game being inconsistent in most other aspects too. The story is alright, decently paced and has a really hype cliffhanger at the end.;28380;I never thought the first two Darksiders games were outstanding in any kind of way, but I thought they were solid, enjoyable games for action-adventure fans who dont mind RPG elements here and there. While the first entry really reminded me of a well done gritty version of a The Legend of Zelda game, the second already disappointed me a bit. It tried to redefine Darksiders as a franchise by throwing the nice puzzles Darksiders had over board, replacing them with even more combat, a larger world and an RPG-esque skilltree which only worked semi-well in my opinion. Maybe that exactly is the reason why I find Darksiders III so mediocre, because it still struggles to find an identity, copying successful IPs to live up to expected sales numbers. Darksiders III consists of heavy influence from the Souls games in terms of enemy placement, boss fights, level structure, progression system and crafting, a tiny bit of Bayonettas combat system and a bunch of classic action-adventure elements. But lets get into the review.;1. Blatantly copying the Souls series in a multitude of aspects, but in a very subpar manner  2. Dull and empty world  3. Boring, uninspired and misplaced puzzles  4. Inconsistent and overall unsatisfying visuals  5. Stark performance issues  6. Inconsistent, wonky hitboxes;48;1. No unnecessary sidequests or tasks  2.

The obviousness of disc 2 being rushed is heartbreaking because otherwise this game, fully realized of course, mightve been on par to compete with the lieks of FF7 or Chrono Trigger as the greatest JRPG of all time.  Sadly, it is a beautifully flawed game that executes so much in its story, characters, and epic scale themes thats its hard to knock it in the end.  Only real gripe Id say is the random encounters could get MAD tedious at points, but otherwise evewrything else about this game is stellar beyond comparison.

3234;;Ori and the Blind Forest really surprised me. Ive been seeing it in the Xbox Store for awhile now and thought itd be a boring indie game that Id give up on after an hour or so. Only reason I even played it was because it was added to Game Pass. By the end of the introduction I loved it. It was emotional and left me in shock and awe, and I did tear up a little....AT THE INTRO!!! Ive been playing it for a couple weeks now, and I just beat the game. The ending not only had be tear up, but literally shed tears!! Obviously not going to spoil what happens, but I was not expecting what happens.  Im sitting here trying to describe the game and what I love about it, but theres just so much there to write about. Theres literally an hour between the last paragraph and this one, because Im struggling to put into words my thoughts on this game. The gameplay is amazing, the music is powerful (and the soundtrack is on Spotify), and the exploration is one of the best Metroidvania-style games since Super Metroid. You progressively get upgrades so the game is constantly getting more and more interesting. Every upgrade I got made me excited, as it meant more areas I could access and things I could do.  Im really excited about Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and am upset that theres no definitive release date yet. It just says 2019.  The only complaint I have with this game is the extreme difficulty during some parts. While most of the game is just the right amount of challenging, there are certain parts of the game which caused me to rage quit for a couple days. Its mostly when completing the main areas, you have to escape the area while being chased by a flood, or lava, or the main villain, or something. However, I would only want those parts difficulty level lowered slightly. If it was slightly lowered itd actually feel like an accomplishment when completing those sections. There come a point when you fail an area so much it stops being fun, and completing it is less I did it! and more ABOUT FREAKING TIME!!!.  And for that reason, and that reason only, Im giving this game a 9 out of 10 instead of a perfect score.;7344;;Difficulty too high at certain points;;Beautiful soundtrack Progressive upgrades Great Metroidvania Never got boring;c;37707;242744

3236;I enjoyed the first 10 hours or so for the most part. But it dragged on and felt more like a grind as I continued to play. More of a disappointment for me.;Year after year, Ubisoft had consistently turned out an Assassins Creed game. Obviously, this led to the franchise feeling stale, so the company put the game on a year break and made a comeback with 2017s Assassins Creed: Origins. In many ways, that new entry differentiated itself from the previous ones, adding new RPG mechanics that were appreciated but ultimately werent enough. Enter Assassins Creed: Odyssey, the game that took those mechanics and fleshed them out a bit more. Add in a coherent narrative and a more focused RPG system and we have ourselves a solid game, right? Well, not exactly. Although this game was decent for the most part, issues from previous entries and shady business practices held it back from being something good.  What most Ubisoft open-world games suffer from is repetitiveness and a lack of variety. However, the Assassins Creed franchise has always been the biggest culprit of this. Even though I found Odyssey to be no as egregious, it was still plagued with repetitive busy work. Towards the end of my journey XP began to feel less and less abundant. I constantly found myself having to partake in tons of side-activities because many of the main-quests were blocked off due to a level gap. This was my main issue for sure, because if the game never forced me to take up side-quests then I would have found the pacing to be much more fluid and controlled. This grind towards the end screeched the game to a halt, and from there on I wasnt having much fun. This was disappointing since before this XP wall I found myself having some fun with the side content.   Side-missions were an improvement from Origins. Some of them were multi-layered and presented me with some fun objectives and challenges. But not all of them were like that. A good chunk of them consisted of fetching an item or talking to people to find someone. However, good or bad, the one aspect that plagued these side-missions was definitely the dialogue and characters. I found a few of the people I met to be interesting and well voice acted. Some of them, though, not so much. Since the game introduced a dialogue system to the franchise, conversations were a bit more dynamic, which was appreciated. Yet this also led to some really awkward or unfocused interactions. They even added romance options for certain NPCs, and they were by far the most cringe-worthy aspect of the dialogue. Many times I was interacting with someone who had a serious problem they were facing, and one of my dialogue options would be to flirt. I mean I did find this aspect to be pretty terribly funny, but nonetheless it completely sucked me out of the experience.   Side-quests werent the only string of activities available, however. Military bases made a comeback with more varying amounts of difficulty and fun to be had. Once you clear out a certain amount of bases in a single region, then the ability to join the sides of either Sparta or Athens to aid them in a battle against each other was unlocked. These battles were pretty underwhelming, sadly. It mostly consisted of killing a certain amount of the enemy team to win, which was a let down since I found them to be a neat concept. But if youre not partaking in side-quests or large-scale battles, the return of hunting and collectibles were available to check off the list. Hunting was still unengaging and boring since all you did was point and shoot at them with a bow to kill them. From there, selling the pelt for currency was pretty much all you can do with it. And as for collectibles, they were extremely bland and unremarkable, so I never found any incentive to find them. There was a lot more side-content the game had to offer. But I just dont feel like discussing them since there is nothing to say about them. Like I said, most of the game felt like busy work, like checking stuff off a list, so consistency in fun factor was very rocky for me.  The one element that I did have more consistent fun with, for a while, was the open-world exploration and combat. From a purely visual standpoint, the game was absolutely beautiful drawing me to explore and see the gorgeous vistas and landscapes. However, it wasnt all flash and no substance. The lands of Ancient Greece were home to many caves, cities, and shipwrecks. On my journey across the islands and through these locations, many combat and stealth scenarios came into play. The stealth system here felt much more fluid as animations were seamless for quick kills. However, getting caught meant combat was a guarantee. Combat, here, was genuinely fun, mostly due to the upgrade system. Using skill-points you could unlock special moves such as the Spartan Kick, which is self-explanatory. These special moves added a more strategic approach since you had to conserve your energy bar to execute one. As for the regular sword to sword combat, I found it to be decent. Nothing great, but a solid combat system that did feel a bit clunky from time to time. Ship combat even made a return, with more customizable options and the ability to manage your crew, which was a welcomed edition. All this sounds great, and it was, for the first ten or so hours. After that point, it was the same game-play loop for the rest of it. Just like the XP grinding and side-content, this aspect started to become pretty stale by the end. This mostly had to do with the enemies being complete tanks, often soaking up thousands of damage points. This effectively made many of the encounters towards the end of the game to feel tiresome and even boring.   The one aspect that stayed, mostly, interesting throughout was the narrative. Odyssey chose to put a larger focus on a multi-pathed narrative. This new choose your path narrative element was a welcomed addition, but one that came with some clunky and messy story beats. A couple of times the plot tried to focus on too many things at once. One moment Im dealing with a cult searching for a powerful item and the next moment Im fighting a war for Sparta. I found that aspect to be the most jarring, however, as a whole I found the story-line this time around to be much more interesting and less formulaic than the previous games. Id say the biggest thing holding it back was the dialogue once again, but it didnt drag the narrative that much except when it came to missions centered around it. I was happy that the game didnt follow the basic revenge plot that almost every Assassins Creed game followed. This time it was a bit more complicated and open-ended which had a lot to do with the dialogue system. The system, here, was better than how it worked in the side-missions. Since some of the options actually affected the outcome of some of the story. Some of the time there was no drastic change, but when it came to certain decisions, they had quite a bit of effect on the over-arching narrative. That was the biggest pleasant surprise, and it really helped make the story less linear, which effectively made it more interesting for me, even if it was convoluted at times.   By the end of my thirty-hour adventure through Ancient Greece, I was exhausted. The game had overstayed its welcome, and all in all, my journey felt forgettable. I never felt as if I needed to go back and keep on exploring because I had already experienced everything there was in the first ten hours. Potential was clearly visible, but the Ubisoft open-world formula bogged it down to where the game, in the end, was pretty generic.;103054;This is my review of the new Assassins Creed game. Hope who ever reads this enjoys it.;- Messy plot, although more interesting than most AC plots. - Majority of the last half of the game felt too much of a grind. - Bland characters - Ultimately forgettable experience due to repetitive last half.;48;- Beautiful visuals - Good combat - Decent amount of well constructed quests - Fun first 10 hours - Decent RPG mechanics;Assassin.s Creed: Odyssey Review - Failed Potential;38638;223035
3237;;The game is a AAA title, but all in all It is just a descent console port.  The moment I saw the lock system and that the fighting depends heavily on that I knew that this game is Not made for the PC market in mind. You have to lock yourself to a enemy and use a key to switch between them... come on... I have a mouse and I do not need that ****.  I found the game harder, which is kind of cool at some point, but rater unfitting with the older ones.  I do not recommend buying it even on sale.;28380;;Console port  Terrible flaw in the fighting system with the lock and dodge - this is meant for controller.   Boring (I killed the third SIN and gave up)  The world is really empty, everything looks the same to me  Hate the console save game implementation;6;Performs OK The sound is OK The graphics are OK It has some Puzzles;c;35988;250078
3238;;A fun game for people who like guitar  hero but on PC instead. I highly recommend an osu tablet because it is much more fun than on mouse and it can get really competitive when you play ranked beat maps. It may also help you in getting good in anything too. For example like quick reflexes. Overall, I liked the community and the beat maps I have downloaded and played over the last decade.;3012;;nothing;;helps you in anything;c;38077;250294
3239;;Great deconstructive approach to ARPG. Gameplay is fun and diverse enough, overall visuals are nice and sound is fine too. It doesnt tend to get repetitive even with long playthroughs. However, last level group, or Hell, has somewhat counterintuitive (and unpleasant to the eyes) visual design, so, sadly, I never got to finish it. Nevertheless, its a fine game beside that.;22747;;Visual design of last level group aka Hell.;;;c;33098;250724
3240;;Brilliant story-driven game that leaves an impression. Despite a slow, lacklustre start, the game is engrossing and youll find yourself wanting to finish it in one go. The gameplay mechanics are simple:  the game mostly consists of dialogue choices and an FM radio mechanic which can be used to find secrets.  The game art and music is wonderfully unique and both chilling yet oddly charming. Although you can replay the game, theres not much incentive to do so. Whilst I found the characters compelling enough, I didnt feel I would discover much more about them with different dialogue choices and a different ending. Overall, if youre looking for a relatively short game with a focus on narrative, this is one of the best out there.;14587;;Little replayability;;Brilliant soundtrack & sound effects Captivating story Unique, beautiful art style;c;42980;251044
3241;;Obvious classic. Endless replayability, immersive world and, obviously, an incredible soundtrack. Having played on both PC and PS3, the PC version is infinitely better. The number of mods available drastically broadens what you can do with the game and the console enables you to fix some potentially game breaking bugs. The story is, however, flat and predictable. There arent many characters in the game who are memorable or, honestly, even interesting. Fortunately, its easy to completely avoid questlines and go your own way and still have potentially hundred of hours of gameplay left. Otherwise, the mechanics and skill tree hold up, there is so much to do in the world (even without mods), and it is still a beautiful game.;472;;Bethesda bugs Flat storyline;;Almost infinite replayability Mods, mods, mods Solid gameplay mechanics;c;42980;251045
3242;;On paper, Fallout 4 is a good game. The game begins with your character narrowly escaping the bombs that are the origin of all Fallout games and losing everything they held dear. Its a powerful start to the game, witnessing the war that is only alluded to in all other Fallout games. If youre looking forward to the climactic end of the story, you may as well stop playing here, because the game stops being interesting at this point. There are more deaths, more gun fights, more plot twists ahead in the story but I could not have cared less by the time I got to the end for various reasons. - The revised dialogue system is a disaster. Youre only given hints as to what your character is going to say. E.g. sarcastic could mean anything from your character making a light-hearted jibe to launching a head-on barrage of insults at an unwitting NPC. - Bugs are rampant and infuriating. - Few of the characters in-game are sympathetic or even likeable. There is a lot of exploring that can be done and the in-game world is expansive. If youre into customisation, theres plenty of armour and weapons to mess around with. But the whole game feels very shallow and superficial: whats the point of spending hours on tesla rifles just to use them on yet more raiders? With the exception of Far Harbour, the story of which raises some interesting ethical questions, theres not much point getting the DLC. I dont regret buying Fallout 4 since I have sunk a lot of hours into it but this is, at the very best, an average game. Looking for a compelling Fallout story? Play New Vegas.;9630;;So many bugs Honestly its just really boring;;Very solid gameplay mechanics Replayable;c;42980;251052
3243;;A journey into the mind of a psychotic person. A disturbing experience, expertly delivered. The only game i know of that offers this kind of immersion. I absolutely loved this game. Its a unique experience for those mature enough to understand it. The face animations are so good that you can actually feel the fear and despair. I found that the simple combat system was great because i had something simple that i could hang on to while everything else went to sh*t. Thank you for this experience.

3247;Overall the game is good if you want an almost-Windwaker-esq game. But be prepared to random puzzles in combat and exploration and consider how your abilities can chain together to solve it.;The game is very well-made, but I feel combat needed some more work. Between the lack of a lock on and the long animations, combat can be cumbersome at times. I wasnt prepared for the problem solving by chaining together abilities to attack bosses, and wish I knew that ahead of time rather than looking up how to solve bosses. Maybe this game is hard because its easy to lose health points, and hard to restore your health during battle waves. Or maybe its easy because you get to replenish your health between battles and can combine abilities in a way that seemed like cheating.  The game is mostly straightforward. Even though levels are formulaic in some ways, they are thoughtful and unique. The well crafted puzzles come out of nowhere and are harder to solve because of random difficulty spikes. Its always obvious in retrospect, but unexpected at the moment.;28692;I love playing Zelda and bought this game because it seemed like a Windwaker-esque game.;▫ Not much direction ▫ Puzzle nature of boss fights unclear ▫ Combat is fast but imprecise;130;▫ Fun to run around ▫ Combat is fast past ▫ Based on real locations ▫ Based on real folklore;Zelda, but in ancient Mexico;42634;251700
3248;;Amazing art style and music. The story is very basic but interesting enough. This is the kinda game where you will suddenly die out of your control, and you use your new knowledge to do better. Its a game I found mostly satisfying, yet sometimes frustrating. Controls were sometimes unresponsive or didnt do what I intended, but that is understandable for a game of this age. A very short game Id recommend anyone to play through once.;4348;;Controls, some puzzles werent intuitive.;48;Art style, music, main character.;An excellent game that has aged pretty well.;42957;251743
3249;;Gorogoa is all about puzzles, if there was any story-line there, I didnt get it. I played it on a Mac but it felt from the start that it belongs to an ipad. The puzzles are very innovative indeed and a little bit challenging, but still It took me less than 3 hours to finish the game, which is not a lot. I liked Gorogoa but I find the overwhelming positive reviews a little bit too much. I always rate using comparative evaluation with regards to other similar games Ive played, so I decided a 6/10 for Gorogoa, which is a good rating in my personal (strict) evaluation scale.;9136;;I didnt particularly liked the hand drown graphics.  Short for its price. Story is not straight forward. Where is the music?;;Very innovative puzzles. Havent played this kind of adventure game before, and Ive played A LOT.  Challenging at times.;c;8384;251980
3254;;Almost everything about this game is perfect- the innovation, the expanding of characters stories and arcs, the reimagining of events that are more grounded and stremalined, etc, etc, etc.  Its hard not to give this game a 10 honestly, but the only thing thats kind of missing is maybe the buildup and payoff part of the story that I felt got undercut by something just being lackluster for the scenario.  Cant 100% put my finger on it, but I think it has to do with the boss battles being nearly identical between scenarios which wouldnt make sense from a plot perspective- sort of what I would call a silly oversight from a narrative point of view- basically there should have been more interaction between Leon and Claire throughout the game, and things that one person already did should be made less similar in the 2nd Run.  I think this was handled more cohesively and more logically in the original and is part of what made it a classic in the first place.  Regardless, everything else about this game is beyond the moon amazing, especially the graphics- my GOD they look good.  Plus with so much replay value- so close to perfection and Im sure those new to the franchise will find it bar-setting in terms of the whole package coming together.

3255;;Speaking as a fan of the series. JoJos Bizarre Adventures All Star Battle is one of the most best fighting games and references many points in the Comics, Its fighting mechanics are fresh and very flexible which lets people to play in any kind of style using the same charachter.  It has many modes such as Story mode,arcade mode,Online multiplayer,Versus and Campaign mode. The graphics are amazing and share the same artistic look as the comics. The story mode is not advised to be played by people who plan to get into the Comics since the story mode spoils the story of the series in a very lame and uninteresting way.

3257;;Its really fun. My favorite moments of the game are when totally unexpected things happen. For example, you try to shoot someone (with very clunky controls) and at that time the baddies shoot the rope that supports the crate you are standing on, then you fall down with a crate into toxic waste that instantly kills you, but as you fall you shoot an exploding barrel that kills the baddies and in the end no one wins. :( Overall a good game, but not much of an improvement from the first Superfighters (that is free online). I was hoping for the developers to fix the controls for the Deluxe version, but its exactly the same. Before you buy this one check out the free version online and then make your decision.;10039;;Controls. You have to stand still in order to aim. Its painful.

3261;;The game has okay graphics and okay sound, and the setting, while not very original, showed promise prior to release, but thats about it.   RTS mechanics are implemented VERY poorly, for example, units in a group always move at their top speed, and the difference between speeds of different units can be quite significant. Unit upgrades are few and not very useful.  Pathfinding is also quite poor, and at times it unpredictably just refuses to work, i.e. units are not moving when commanded though nothing visibly inhibits their movement. Certain units supposed to wander the map automatically for gameplay reasons sometimes just stand in a quiet corner and refuse to act on their own.  GUI is clunky and not very responsive, plot interactions are done via dialogs which dont pause the game, and enemy can perfectly fine strike while those are open. Tooltips are uninformative (like when units skill usage is locked no explanation present as to why).  Graphics, as stated above, are okay, but the game is not very optimised. Theres nothing very fancy looks-wise in it, and the resource consumption is quite high.  All in all, its just a bad game, really.;81352;;GUI, pathfinding, group mechanics and RTS mechanics overall.;;Setting.;c;33098;254947
3262;;Bloodborne ha sido un juego el cual no me he pasado y además solo he vencido a La Bestia Clérigo y al Padre Gascoigne, pero me aventuro a dar la puntuación sobre este juego referida a la parte que llevo jugada. Me encanta la temática, gráficos muy bien encajados para un juego así, historia interesante y caracterización digna de From Software. Lo único malo que le veo (Y sí, malo para mí, ya que a los amantes del juego les gustará) es la dificultad, ya que a veces se hace difícil seguir jugando ya sea por los nervios o el tilteo. Tampoco exigo un selector de dificultad ni nada, es más, este juego está perfecto como está y aun más para los habituales consumidores de juegos del género.

World War ll me gustó bastante más que a muchos  y Black Ops lll es mi CoD favorito. ¿Por qué? Simplmente porque me gusta prácticamente todo de él: sus mapas, armas, especialistas, gráficos, increíble movilidad y gameplay en general... aunque también tiene sus cosas malas, como el matchmaking, una pequeña e inevitable parte de jugadores imbéciles y cretinos, la lamentable conexión a veces y el terrible mal balance de algunas armas respecto a las demás, entre otros pequeños detalles. En general, muy buen juego con el cual divertirse solo o con amigos, con opción de competitivo, aunque ya en horas muy bajas por obvias razones (2015-2019...) y gran variedad de modos de juego.

In this story, we have recently arrived in Kalos and are about to get our first pokémon with our friends, there are two other friends that will choose with you their Kalos starters, you will pick first and your main rival, as obvious, will pick the strongest type against yours, like every other start in the series.  The main focus of the story is mega evolution which is developed poorly, with a weak antagonist.

3266;;A very big surprise of a game that takes quite a bit from previusly established comic book/super hero games (Arkham in particular) and ramps it up and improves upon most facets already establisshed.  The graphics are impressive, especially the facial animations of the main cast, and overall it is one of the best looking games to date period, though I will say the NPC side characters look a little bland at times.  There was a tremendous amount to do, so much so in fact that it became a little unnecessary and overwhelming to finish everything in the end, but thats better than not having enough.  Only real criticism of note would be that it maybe felt a little long and not quite as well paced and tight as Id hoped, however the characters and story were pretty memorable and well thought out.

The locations keep changing, the dialogue is funny and its not hard, so its amusing. The missions can feel pretty long, however. There were also a few bugs, like during the first chase where I couldnt steer until I reset the mission manually.;2177;;▫ Go to location, press A (very simple) ▫ Sometimes the Switch struggles to keep up (choppy) ▫ So automatic that you rely on it knowing what you are trying to do;130;▫ Fun game with funny dialogue ▫ Fun to play Lego and destroy things ▫ Looks simple but nice;Fun Time Killer;42634;257504

I sometimes find progression hard and small randomly generated planets at the start sometimes glitch in ways that make it hard to complete. But you can always delete them and try a new one. It also took me time to realize how to generate a planet of a different type than the previous planet.

3273;;The main gameplay takes most of the hassle out and speeds up the game. There was just enough time to say something or grab a handful of chips between turns. Unlike early reviews, the frame rate is steady and load times fixed.  The game worked great with 5 people on one Switch, everyone using their own JoyCon, JoyCon Grip, Pro and 8bitdo controllers. It automatically pulled player names from user profiles, or lets you use Player X.

3290;All in all, for the story mode of For Honor, which gives us a repetitive but entertaining sort of RPG fighting game, ill give it a 6/10.;After grinding my way to level 100 on Fallout 76, I was looking for a game I could start and finish in one day. And being a PS Plus subscriber I found myself downloading For Honor.  Not because of the multiplayer aspect of it, but for the story mode that, according to the website How Long to Beat takes aprox. 7 to 8 hours to conclude.  Sounded reasonable, so I took the chance.  The good: the atmosphere and how well they built a common lore for three different cultures. It took me about 8.5 hours to finish this and it seemed like 5. It was quite entertaining. The graphics while not being top notch are effective and work quite well. Game mechanics and controls are easy to learn. And game difficulty even at easier settings can be challenging.  The so-so: character progression is almost non existant. You gain story experience levels and unlock a few perks you can only change between levels. Only two at the time.  The negative: combat feels repetitive and after a couple of hours hours it gets stiff and boring. The characters are slow, vikings are sluggish. Level design is ok most of the times. Feel diverse. But sometimes its just laughable how childish the missions are. The elephant sequence feels out if place and the Gudmundr boss fight is annoying as hell. Final boss fight with Appolyon feels underwhelming since i could basically hit her a couple of times and run around to regain my health (using the perk regain health while not in combat!) while she would run after me in circles. Dumb AI.;11162;This is a review solely based on the story mode of For Honor.;;48;;Story mode review;9819;259118
3291;;Fantastic gameplay and pretty middling story. Theres effectively no story at all until the final couple hours, in which they wrap up nearly every single loose thread like they forgot homework was due that day.

3292;;This game suffers primarily from a preoccupation with ~~C L E V E R N E S S~~. It actually aligns pretty closely to some of my personal game beliefs, such as not having any actual characters are story to speak of, but finds itself trapped in the very generic world of Middle American Office Life Is Bad sorts of cleverness that has not only been hack since 2004, but also limits dramatically the turf that the game is going to be free to explore.

3298;All in all, Fallout 76 is major disappointment. It has great ideas but very few actually were well executed.  It will undoubtedly go through history as one of the worst AAA titles ever.  I sincerely hope Bethesda learnt their lesson and start working their asses off not only for Starfield and TES VI, but also bring Fallout back to its former glory.  5/10;Even after witnessing the terrible Beta launch and horrifying streams, I gave Bethesda the benefit of doubt and rest assured that they would improve the game in the following 2 to 3 weeks tops. Oh boy was I wrong.  The positive:  The game truly entertains you. If youre a lore freak like me, going through the survivors stories, overseers mission and all, it felt compelling, even if not the best of Fallout stories. The cake goes to the Order of Mysteries quests. Great storytelling and characters even if theyre all dead. The map. I dare saying its the best Fallout map ever. Its varied and big as hell. Each zone has its own perils and progressively feel more challenging. From The Forest until Cranberry Bog, they increasing sense of danger is well built and the variety of creatures helps building atmosphere. Survival: its pretty much reduced to managing thirst, hunger and longevity of armor/guns. And this is actually a good thing!  The survival elements are well mingled with the Fallout world and environment. Its not Survival Fallout, its Fallout with survival elements and this was in my opinion well thought by Bethesda. Perk card system. Even with obvious limitations that ill talk about in the negatives, this system was really interesting and rewarding. Exploration. Tied to the richness of map variety and environments, exploration is what kept so long in the game. It felt really cool preparing food and repairing stuff before leaving my Camp and go out exploring new locations. Theres was a sense of discovery very hard to replicate in other games. Camp system. Even being subject to exploits, this Camp system was a victory for Bethesda. It worked really well for most part, and it proved  to be a useful tool throughout the game, specially in the mid-levels when enemies got tougher.  The negative:  Where to start... The perk card system. Yes its good, but quite limitative as well. Wasting points on lockpicking or computer hacking instead of.putting these perks as passive is a bad choice. I understand having to equip Super Duper (a perk that grants the possibility to duplicate a crafted item), Ammosmith (same but for ammo) or repairing guns/armor perk cards whenever I have to use them. But when you have to chose between an attack increasing perk and a lockpicking one is unfair. The remain choice is to equip the attack and when a lock needs opening I go to my perk build and equip momentarily the lockpick card. This breaks game rhythm and found myself ignoring a lot of locks because I didnt want to waste time changing cards.  Bugs. Yeah we all know how many. Glitches. Quest and Event breaking bugs are demoralizing, and Fallout 76 had tons of these for weeks.  Combat. Simply put its atrocious. Vats is broken and functions like an aim bot. It locks enemies on target and slows you down, while untargeted foes keep their normal speed and attack from the sides while youre slow-mo reloading your gun. And if you press exit the vats (button O) it will reset your reloading! Even if youre half way through the reloading animation... Enemies are often bullet sponges and scorchbeasts are probably the worst enemy design/AI ive ever seen. Theyre basically worst copies of Skyrims dragons.  Same with ghouls or mole rats. Theyre designed to annoy you. They track your presence and basically sprint or teleport at light speed and hit you before you realize whats happening.   Poor reward for exploration. Exploration as I said before feels great. However, very often in my incursion I basically destroyed tons of ammo and stimpaks and came back with few valuable things. I dare saying that junk ends up being the rewards for most locations. The location design is Fallout as usual. You get  there, you fight a specific type of enemy and loot the place, in the end of the location (highest point ir deepest room) theres always a chest or a valuable loot of some sort. In the case of Fallout 76 the end loot was for most of the times useless and unrewarding.  Lack of endgame content. The overseers mission is not over yet. We know that there is new content coming. But having the scorchbeast queen event as the final thing to do is very very poor.  Theres no after this event stuff to do. No actual rebuilding Appalachia or creating trading posts. Whitespring hub was turned into a vulgar farming spot and player interaction is limited to trade, kill stuff together and pvp. Theres no room for co-op rebuild areas mode for example.  PvP. Im glad pvp failed. It has.in my opinion no place in a Fallout game. But no one expect such a friendly environment between players. It probably surprised even Bethesda themselves. They had to include pvp incentives through patches, and even then players are not really adhering to it.  Subsequent patches. Adding very little to the game and rendering it more and more grindy with nerfs and whatnots. It shows the absence of plans and direction for this mess.;103020;Being an old timer Fallout mega fan, I bought my Fallout 76 physical copy for PS4 in day 1.

3302;;After 14 years we can finally say it. Its here. Kingdom Hearts 3 is one of the most anticipated games in arguably our generation so far. Ever since number two came out, Ive graduated school, joined the military, fell in love, traveled the world, and have a professional career. A lot has happened in my life since Sora returned to Destiny Islands to be reunited with Kairi and the rest of his friends. But the story couldnt end there. There were too many plot holes not filled, too many loose ends not tied, and evil was still after Kingdom Hearts. The story was not over. So lets start this experience up.  EYECANDY - The visuals in Kingdom Hearts 3 is a definite highlight of the game. The whole entire game looks like a fully rendered Disney movie and at times, the cinematography is so great that you will be watching a movie at times. Just straight up. The video direction, art department, and animation studios went all out and spared no expense. Whether youre battling toys with Woody and Buzz, Riding the tram at Twilight Town, or sailing at The Caribbean, no detail was missed or looked over and not at any one point with the visual experience that Square Enix delivers disappoints.   SOUNDDESIGN - So theres not a lot going on in the sound department here. Which isnt necessarily a bad thing. It just means there wasnt anything innovating or new, but they more played it safe. BUT this was also where they cut some budgeting. The biggest drawback is its voice actors. The voice acting in Kingdom Hearts 3 is so hit or miss its not even funny. Some of the actors are the their counterpart from the movies, others are sound-alikes and do a decent job, and some are just terrible. Bland delivery, no emotion, no character, just straight up bad. And even then, the direction of the voice acting and the writing was so cringey at times I was playing it by myself and felt embarrassed. Now the bright side though would be the music. It was great. The composer did a phenomenal job in keeping the world songs familiar, but at the same time putting the Kingdom Hearts spin on it. So if we were to look at the aspects of the sound in this game it would go like this: Soundtrack 10/10, sound design, not great but overall not bad, voice acting? Jesus.  GAMEPLAY - The first thing youll feel on your controller is the pace of the game. The maps are huge, Sora is almost constantly sprinting, sliding, dashing, and jumping from enemy to enemy getting knocked back, recovering, and getting back into the action. Which is a good thing but the game made it an overwhelming system. Especially with its new attractions combat mechanic. Which are quite literally Disneyland rides with LEDs all over them. Theres the teacups, carousel, the Buzz blaster(?), pirate ship, pretty much all the rides that are famous at the happiest place on earth. Honestly, theyre pretty dumb in my opinion. And that was partly due to the fact that easily ten hours into the game its still giving me tutorials on other new game features that they shoved in. Which on one side is a good thing because all these details really do tailor to the whole play as you want approach but on the other end it feels wrong because these arent major abilities, power ups, or upgrades. Like typically in a game when a major mechanic is introduced I think its more than appropriate to have a tutorial or practice section in the game where you can get used to that mechanic. Or if its a new item or weapon so you build that situational familiarity within the game. Examples noted like God of War or Zelda. The main issue at hand is you forget all of the abilities available to you and youre unsure of what to use when, and which mechanic would work best on which enemy or situation. When youre not fighting the heartless, theres very little the game offers to have you explore or revisit each world. Youll waste minutes on top of hours aimlessly searching for hidden chests, items, or any other little goodies that you might think will be lying around. Which actually Ill give them the balance of having good level design because while the game is open, its still linear. Meaning that Kingdom Hearts 3 does a really good job of leading you where they want you to go, and if there is anything hidden to be found, theyll give it to you. There will be a character cue, or a not-so-hidden- path, or something of that nature. The game is extremely assist heavy, and theres almost no difficulty to the game. I was going into worlds almost ten levels above me, no potions, unequipped, and decimating boss battles without any issues. Out of the entire game I only died around seven times, most of it being at the end where there is a noticeable difficulty spike. Which was what made the game enjoyable because it was finally a challenge and I was no longer bored with the game. But this wasnt the only aspect of inconsistency in the game.  STORY - The narrative in Kingdom Hearts 3 is the lowest point and the highlight of this game. As convoluted the story has become with its almost Game of Thrones style writing and character weaving, number three did a great job to keep you up to speed at the beginning but didnt do a great job as to figuring out how to lead you to the end of the game. You aimlessly travel from world to world for quite literally no reason, er rather the reason of following your heart, but even if that was the driving factor to progress the story, when you go to these other worlds, once again theres no reason. Organization XIII might show up every now and again, but rarely do they actually have a motive for invading these worlds. It didnt have that flow and sense of adventure the last two had. You quite literally just jump from one world to the next for fan service and to get the world specific keyblade. At one point Org13 reveal that they have plans which is why theyre at that world, i.e. experimenting on others for their endgame plan, and that aspect couldve easily been a forwarding factor in the story. And it requires minimal writing so it couldve been easily implemented. I would go into it more, but spoilers would follow. The only good part about the game is about the last five hours where the actual story sits. Its the only moment in the game where the pacing picks up, it gains momentum, you want to keep playing it, and then it ends. And even then, theres parts in the ending that just drag it out and they stuff with filler just to make it about an hour longer, or at least thats how it felt to me because while the part Im talking about loosely fit, it just didnt make sense as to why. Like it was a sudden shift in tone and characters and it was minorly off-putting and I found myself staring at the screen quizzically wondering where this section came from. But I digress. Without going too into, the ending of this game is done pretty well, and the final cutscene... Itll give you mixed feelings.  CONCLUSION - At the end of the day a lot of this game is filler. I spent about 15 hours cluelessly flying from world to world only to actually having an engaging story start up at around 20 hours and then finally play something of quality almost 23 hours in. For about 5 hours. So the game can be beat in less than 30 hours. Its still directed towards children and meant to be family friendly. Which is fine. But the average age group, or demographic, of the people playing this game on average are not the children you had back in 2002 when the first Kingdom Hearts released. I get it, its Disney. But youd think the game wouldve grown up with us at least a little bit. All in all, this game is Kingdom Hearts 2.5. There was nothing Square Enix did to set this one apart from the other two games in the trilogy.;2933;;Mediocre voice acting Story pacing Hours of filler Overall difficulty of the game;;Soundtrack is enjoyable Visually gorgeous Compelling climax to the story;c;1370;260740
3303;;A simple run and gun with arguably the best implementation and use of a slow-motion mechanic in gaming history.;18;;-Story My criticism isnt about its over the top cheesiness and overuse of noir tropes--thats a plus--its that it loses steam halfway through, takes itself too seriously, becomes unnecessarily convoluted and ruins its charm by the end.  -Enemy positioning An inexperienced player would find the positioning of some enemies unfair.  -Bullet spread Some weapons have too wide of a bullet spread at greater distances, which by the end of the game renders them obsolete.;;-Pace Minimal exploration means youre always on the hunt of the next objective. Its linear, but its focused linearity that fits the story of the game. Perfect for speedrunning. Action is always around the corner, but that doesnt mean youre always bombarded with enemies. There is a good balance of engaging and breaking to move forward. Relatively fast load times.  -Skill develops better gameplay Fairly casual game, but an experienced player can take advantage of bullet time in a way that allows them to be in slow-motion for practically the entirety of an engagement and never need pain killers, even on the highest difficulty.  -Graphic Novels Allow for a stylized vision of the story to be told effectively without feeling out of place.  -Simple Only a few game mechanics that synergize well with each other.;c;43966;259144
3304;;A very clever game overall, both in regards to the puzzles as well as the narrative being very cryptic and sparse but with quite a bit of dark humor.  The standout part of this game is for sure the characters, which given that a lot of the dialogue felt VERY natural kind of points to the fact that they pretty much let them improve a lot of it (which works awesome).  In the end, I probably wanted even more puzzles, a longer journey maybe, but for what there is here I think its one of the smartest games around.  And fun too, but maybe a little easy in the end.

3306;;Pretty much Gran Turismo 5+, but with loads more content. If youll like this will all depend on if you could live with GT 5s flaws. The AI is still pretty deadbeat at times and there is still no damage model to speak of but as an encyclopedia of cars and tracks GT 6 still pretty much goes unrivaled. The amount of special cars is staggering, with as cherry on the top, the special Vision by Gran Turismo cars.  To add up you have to be (or become) a bit of a car nerd to fully enjoy GT 6. The races themselves are still fun, but to get everything out of it you have to get fun out of experiencing all these different car feels on different tracks. Me myself had loads of fun just compiling a personal drift leaderboard on a certain track where I would just try loads of cars to see which ones would drift best. A totally arbitrary thing to do, but one I got loads of fun out.;7316;;Fixes none of GTs long lasting issues Only for car enthousiasts, if you dont care much about the cars you can probably subtract 2 points from the rating.;;Solid driving mechanics  Insane amount of cars and tracks;c;44222;261285
3307;;Gravity rush is an often overlooked stylish game with a beautiful world and exquisite music. The game is not for everyone though, and it being a niche game that had a lack of marketing make it an often overlooked gem.   It is a gem with some rough edges though. The story is pretty vague at times (personally that worked for me to keep me curious but I can easily see that most wont like it). A few of the side missions are tediously designed, luckily the main missions are far more solid. But most fun is just floating through the world, collecting and doing quests. The weird mixed french-Japanese fantasy feeling works wonders for the style and its a truly creative world, assisted by some great music. Most of the main characters strike the right note in terms of charisma and emotion (the very cute and weird made up language helps a lot).   Try this game if you want to experience something new, full of character and mysterious. Its often in sale in the psn store and well worth a try.;12528;;Plot not really cohesive Some sidemissions get your blood boiling (I advise skipping them);;Beautiful music Adorable characters Beautiful visuals Beautiful world thats also rather large Falling through the air is a unique experience;c;44222;261314

That should give you an image of its qualities.   That being said, its a game you play in a weird way, its nothing out of the ordinary to stop playing for a month before picking it up again (its story is quite long). This goes perfectly with its laid back attitude while playing. The music is top notch and the pace is as fast as you want to play.;9927;;Too much repeating dialogue Some minor mechanics a bit convoluted;;Those visuals... wow That soundtrack... wow The ultimate laidback game, very relaxing Easy to stop playing and pick up again after a few weeks Jrpg combat pretty streamlined;c;44222;260859
3309;;My interest in Telltale games had dwindled a lot because the walking dead season 2 and GoT not nearly approached the impact that twd season 1 had on me. I was even actively annoyed by GoT for lacking any satisfaction storywise. So I was happily surprised that tales from the borderlands is a fun ride with interesting characters and nice humor (if you like the absurd borderlands humor). Special mention for the incredible musical opening credits that open each episode.

There arent many games like that anymore. For me I think it deserved to be game of the year 2007, although Call of Duty 4 was a great game too. For a game released back then its not unplayable as the controls arent awkward and the graphics are great! This game is a bargain for the price you can buy now and an excellent start of what is now a stunning trilogy. A must buy game.;20;;Lack of characters;;Unique world.;c;44294;261440
3312;;Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare (Xbox One) Before I start, Id just like to say, I didnt play very much of the original tower defence game. Never been a huge fan of tower defence games but I have certainly enjoyed them at times! Plants vs Zombies isnt a game youd expect to expand its brand into an online warfare game, but rather a player vs player competitive mode. Surprisingly it does online warfare very well. Not a game I put much thought into considering playing, but with a number of games to play for only £3.99 on EA Access, it was something I had to try. Im so happy I did, because I have had so much fun on this game, more than I ever did on the very competitive Call of Duty series. Theres so many different game modes so you could never get bored of playing, you could just simply switch from Team Vanquish (Team Deathmatch) to Garden ops were you are a team of four fighting off waves of Zombies trying to destroy your garden. Another great thing about this game is there are so many different classes to play as, with four for each of the teams. You have the standard soldier for each, the medic with healing abilities etc. My favourite thing about the whole game is the rank system. Each class for both plant and zombie has their own individual rank which then contributes to your overall rank. Each time you rank up with a character your overall rank increases too. The difference here to most online warfare games, is that you dont rank up by gaining experience,  but by completing challenges that are specific to each character, So you could possibly see your overall rank rise more than once during a match. Its a very fun and colourful game, with lots of great maps with plenty to explore. The game is incredibly enjoyable and never boring as I find myself constantly playing to try and increase my rank or fight off waves of zombies on harder difficulties. A nice little homage to the original game is that it lets you plant defensive plant pots to help stop the zombies and lets the zombies spawn other zombies to attack for them. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves online shooters and unique games.;3146;;Lacking in singleplayer;;Great music and fun multiplayer;c;44294;261441
3313;;Shadows of the Damned (Xbox 360) Not a huge title, but certainly an interesting one. I never found out about this game until a few years after its release. To me it was a quiet release and quickly swept under the rug. Im glad I gave this game a go, despite it being in 2016, almost 5 years after its release. The game follows Garcia Hotspur, (a pretty poorly voiced Mexican) travel to the Underworld to save his wife Paula from a demon called Fleming. Not much interest in the main characters although Fleming is quite a flamboyant villian that gives the game some character. Johnson, Hotspurs companion, a talking skull is by far the best character in the game as he brings flair and humour to the game. There was another great character called Christopher, who acted as the games vendor, but he just wasnt involved enough. The game has quite an awkward aim when using guns, it can be quite tricky but gets easier the more you play. The game has unique weapons that are all different variations of pistols, machine guns and shotguns. The game isnt too difficult, nor are the boss fights. The real danger in the game is the Darkness, when it appears it slowly drains your life as you try to escape or shoot a goats head, which provides light and removes the darkness. The graphics arent ground breaking but are far from poor. The camera angle can be quite annoying and the awkward movement of Garcia can be hard to watch. However, the game does play fine, but bum rushing enemies can make it frustrating as you try to kill them. Reloading can be a pain also, as charging enemies will cause the animation to stop if they hit you or you have to dodge them, this was the most frustrating part for me, just trying to reload. An interesting addition was the light shot, it acted as a stun to the enemies and could be used with every gun and costs zero ammo. The melee attack seems pretty pointless and was only ever useful to bat the enemies away and give you some breathing space. The game had innuendos left, right and centre, although the game was quite funny, at times they could get annoying, even the weapons had names like The Hot Boner. The best parts of the game for me were the conversations between Garcia and Johnson, they were both interesting towards the story and humorous. No surprise there was no sequel but definitely worth a playthrough.;5971;;Far too many innuendos;;Funny and a cool world to explore, interesting boss fights;c;44294;261442
3314;;The MAJOR flaw with this game comes from the difficulty curve of it  in the beginning, its infuriatingly hard- you can die very fast, you have no manuverability, etc.  But, near the end- you can WALK right through almost everything, even being able to stand still and gain health if you have the right upgrades.  The story is lame, the characters are paper thin, and overall theres very little if any innovation in this.  Barely worth a playthrough in my opinion.  Score Breakdown  The Tale Story- 4 Pacing- 7 Characters- 6 Originality- 3 Linearity- 6 Length- 7 Epicness- 5  The Presentation Visuals- 8 Display- 7 Music- 6 Sound FX- 7  The Mechanics Ease of Use- 4 Innovation- 6 Replayability- 3;1743;;Wholey unoriginal plot barely worth one playthrough let alone a replay;;Pretty good graphics for the SNES;c;35313;261460
3315;;Extremely formulaic but polished open-world game. Good if youre in the mood for that kind of thing. Its Spider-Man so a lot of the fun is just recognizing characters and places. Wow, there he is...Kingpin! Wow, there it is...Avengers Tower! Welp, enough of that, time to hunt for collectibles.;19565;;;;;c;44344;261484
3316;This game is fun, strategic and hard. Almost too hard for casual players. (Beginner mode may be coming in an update.) A good challenge for single players.;This game is a great update to the original Pac-Man formula. It has 100 unique levels, 3 unique enemy types and several items with different effects. Its good for single or multiplayer gaming. But its hard. The enemies move a little too fast, and some enemies are a little to effective for casual play. This makes the levels, which are often design as a basic puzzle, very hard to complete. Since you start with very few lives shared among all players game overs are common.  There are several sections to the game, each with a number of levels. But if you get a game over, you must restart from the beginning of that section with 4 lives, making progress very hard. This is especially true when playing co-op. I reached out to the developer and suggested he add casual and beginner modes to make it easier to play with casual friends. He seemed to think this was a great idea and implied he was working on it.  Its a very hard game and good for seasoned gamers to play single player.  The versus mode is also a lot of fun, where you chase down your friends. You cannot camp on the last gold coins since the game timeouts and give the victory to the treasure hunters. Its funt and frantic.;114111;In a trailer collection I saw this multi-player Pac-Man game and thought it should be great fun for 4 player game nights, even if its just as a warm up game.;Hard for a party game: you start with few lives, the enemies are fast and the levels are built like puzzle.

3318;;Love the attention to detail and the faithful adherence to the Alien series look and feel. Controls are good, tension is super-high at first, but quickly devolves into repetition.

3319;;When this first came out, I built a PC just to play it. Its one of very few games that I found myself thinking about when not playing it. It may not have held up as well as newer shooters, but after the thematically empty Doom & Quake games... it was a revelation. I might get a lambda tattoo.;231;;Its old news now?;;Atmosphere, action, story, setting, varied objectives...;c;44467;262083

3321;;A hilarious work of perfection. The puzzles are just hard enough, the mechanics are simple but employed to devious extents.

3323;;Its gorgeous, and my first serious gaming experience via Steam Link. The design and scenery are stunningly colorful and creative, although the puzzles and dialogue are not overly remarkable. Unfortunately, the game suffers from some significant stuttering (as of this writing, 2/26,19) that perpetually jars me out of the zone. Painting people or scenery as goals is a new concept, and its used pretty effectively.;17480;;Technical glitches.

3324;;Probably the best - maybe the only - good reason to own a PSVR system and deal with all the cables and setup hassles.

3325;;Oh, its so good. Time only moves when you move. Bullet time taken to an abstract extreme.

3326;;Sure, its STILL in Early Access, but its more SuperHOT... and thats always a good thing. It doesnt deviate far from the standard SuperHOT formula, but theres something going on underneath. I just havent gotten through enough nodes to figure it out. Theyve added some new twists to the game, which Ive enjoyed discovering.;27448;;Early access. Features subject to change.;;More SuperHOT. Levels are somewhat randomized in terms of start location and enemy entrances. Mysterious meta-plot, as before.;c;44467;262093
3327;;Like all things from iD, its a graphical masterpiece. But its got a bad mismatch between the in-game lore (which you find on terminals and the like) and the mindless, endless gunplay. Baddies continue to burst from everywhere, their attacks and movement expertly depicted and animated. But in the end... its DOOM. And weve played DOOM before.;7351;;Stellar graphics cant make up for hollow gameplay.;;Stellar graphics.;c;44467;262094
3328;;The campaigns are good. They are fun to play and I think the game graphics still hold in our days when anyway plenty of games trust the best games ladder without any astonishing graphics. But the real beauty of this game is playing the elitist multiplayer 1v1. It is highly mechanical demanding, it is requiring to absorb lots of information in order to learn something relevant to your skills and even more to start to appreciate the game. It is extremely frustrating to lose in low level especially not knowing what to do and been told why by different people without knowing whos right (because most people including pro gamers have no clue what it is to be a beginner, what it is to have no knowledge of the units and even the hotkeys, that 50 APM it is not yet for you yet for a while). But once you invest the time, it is a fun game. It teaches you that losing does not matter, you are just learning, and soon you become in a state when basically you only win. You win or you learn, so it is a win. Starcraft is an awesome game which has been quite balanced for years - in my opinion.;239;;- many solo games become less fun - ultra frustrating for a beginner - you really need to be a very competitive person - time hungry - hurting my poor wrist if I play 5 minutes a 200APM (I was extremely surprised to see I could once properly taught but the good player way of playing starcraft is just not for me physically) - so many teaching ideas everywhere that do not match your skills (it is not important to scout if you have no clue what to scout, bronze to master are unuseful when the player clicks like lighting speed in bronze level and understand the game like a master player...);6;- saying you play Starcraft makes you gain respect - or at least you think - you learn to lose and not to care - there are still toxicity sometimes but so much less than other multiplayer games - the awesome casters and esport community;Game of a life;44165;262137

3331;;Just Cause 3 was an open-world, mass-destruction masterpiece of nonsense and sheer fun. In JC4, they sucked all the fun out of it by changing one of the key mechanics: conquering territories. In JC3, you accomplished this by destroying all the government and military structures in the area, which makes a sort of sense. Now, to conquer an area, you have to complete all the ridiculous skill challenges: driving, flying, etc. Not only have they removed the reward for blowing things up, they’ve replaced it with something that makes no sense. A failure.;103261;;;;;They Ruined It;44467;262382
3332;Great fun, superbly crafted world and themes with a hilarious humour.  Watch out for the very tough platforming however, it could be rage inducing for some.;Ive always been a big fan of Metroidvanias, so having that coupled with a co-op action brawler is right up my alley really. at first i didnt feel there was a lot of differences introduced from the first one, its very familiar.. which isnt a bad thing per say but it wasnt hugely innovative aside from the added power upgrades and more prominence of the chicken powers (which are a ton of fun XD).  Both the humour and the artwork are fantastic, youll find yourself nodding and smiling all the way through. And it would actually be a very feel good kinda game.. if it werent for the sadistic platforming :D  Dont get me wrong, those controls are buttery smooth and it plays fantastic, but some of the platforming gets insanely hard to the point you have to redo the same screen 50 times in a row, and some of those being the main path not simply the optional chests. The other main issue is that those sections are pretty much impossible in co-op (yet alone with 4 players i imagine!), so you end up with your buddy floating in the air trying to stay out of your way while you desperately try to make it through a screen.;75234;Very much enjoyed the 1st one, played this one 2 player coop so lets see..;harsh platforming difficulty co-op loses its value in the puzzles;130;butter smooth controls the humour :) artwork Chicken powers!;frustratingly clever;3723;262385

More than a few times I just kind of wandered through the world or just went at walking pace to the next objective so I could enjoy the amazing scenery. The combat is slick as hell with a very deep system. The story is memorable but not the main draw, however the main character (Aloy) is fantastic and I truly cared about her journey.

3345;;Mafia II hits sky highs in some points but falls short in other aspects. Narrative in general is a big high in this game. The main plot feels just right in pretty much aspect, being well paced and well written with fully realized characters. Following Vito and Joes rise (or maybe fall) in the criminal underworld is the brightest spot of the whole package. Gameplay-wise, is nothing special. I cant think of anything really off about the game mechanically or contextually, but in the same way nothing really outshines a functional Third Person Shooter from this time. Missions are well designed and have some awesome setpieces, even when restricted by the uninspired gameplay. The single aspect that takes away some of the charm of Mafia II is how useless, the beautiful and well constructed, open world is. The absence of any form of side activities or distractions make the  otherwise well made open world just a meaningless backdrop. Unless you really care to make Vito look the slickest, there isnt much to do in the game outside of the main story.;40;;Meaningless and Wasted Open World;;Great Story Tight, yet by the books, gameplay Great visual and audio atmosphere Graphics that hold up well on PC;c;37026;202659
3346;;I fell in love with Yakuza, from its crime thriller to the absurd weird things that happen in between. Yakuza Zeros beatem up is absurdly fun to play. Each character has four styles of fighting (Neutral, Light, Heavy and an unlockable Ultimate style) that varies between each other (such as Kiryus quick Rush and Majimas agile, dance-like, Breaker) creating variation from each character at the right doses. The difficulty suddenly spikes at the later stages of the game, but its nothing that hinders the experience. One of the clever design choices is by making the overworld small but dense. Full of sidequests and fun and diverse side-activities, that goes from Bowling to underground betting on Bikini Dressed Woman Cat-fight (thats right), Kamurocho and Sõtenbori are lively places full of lively people. The games story sure isnt anything deep. It isnt a game that blew my mind by its deep messaging, yet playing the 30+ hours of Majima and Kyrius story was totally worth it. It is a by the books crime story, but its characters single handily carry the story to greatness. A good story isnt about having complex situations, is about complex and believable reactions by the characters who experience these situations, and this game sure does that. This added to the level of care the developers gave to the most mundane of activities creates believable side-characters and deepens the protagonists even more. Visually the game is good, there is a great level of polish to all of the nooks and crannies of the streets, but the old engine makes the game sometimes look like a maxed out PS3 game on PC. This game is a complete package, and unless you absolutely hate Beatem Ups, theres no reason to not pick up this game. 20 Dollars on Steam is a damn steal.;11397;;;;- Great Gameplay - Competent Story - Excellent Characters - Great Level of polish - Tons of quality Side Content;c;37026;263319
3347;;Game Dev Tycoon is a novel idea but falls short at some points. Dont get me wrong, I LOVE THIS GAME. I play it every day and I love the idea of doing the closest thing of making games while being fully ignorant in this area, but this game isnt perfect. The simple and restrictive design works like a charm when it does and hinders the whole game when it doesnt. The limit of six members on your dev team really helps management at smaller scale games, but reaching AAA development takes unreasonably long thanks to that. I also couldnt find any devs with more than 500 points in either Design or Technology, I needed to train them exhaustively before I could even start to think of Triple-A development, even if I had 2 billion in my pockets. The games story rolls out in a fun way, but the neglection of some consoles (such as the Sega Saturn, the Gameboy Advance and the AMIGA) makes an incomplete and fractured gaming history. Other negative is how static each consoles market share is, every time a new console launches it will immediately go to the top of the sales chart, making it a lot unrealistic. Presentation-wise, the game does its job. This is nothing beautiful to look at neither it is ugly. Game Dev Tycoon is a pleasant game to play, but if youre looking for a hardcore Tycoon experience, this isnt.;2599;;- Its simplicity also affects replay value - Talent Managing for AAA games is a mess and takes too long - Incomplete Game History;;- Good Tycoon game for beginners - Competent Presentation - Good Humor and references - Novel Idea;c;37026;263321

But as I played it and gained power ups I realized I was comparing the fun and speed of the end of Dig 2 with the start of Dig 1. By the end I was having just as much fun. The games are different enough to both be a great experience.  Image & Form worked hard to distill the game experience. Their games seem to transcend their genre. If you played Dig 2 first you may be let down by the graphics, music and randomly generate underground. But its still a compelling experience with many interesting designed elements.;5772;After loving Dig 2 and Heist, I got a chance to play Dig 1.;Graphics are less clean and sharp than Dig 2.

3354;;Yes, it has a striking art style. Yes, it features a great soundtrack, along with some great voice acting.

3356;;This had to potential to be a truly astounding hack-n-slash, but, ironically, its Metal Gear DNA stops it from reaching the exorbitant highs it could have easily reached! Whenever the game has to stop its anime ridiculousness to vainly and superficially preach on the dangers of systematic war, it does so with none of the flair and elegance that Kojima could (at times) pull off. Here, it just feels awkward and out of place. But still, that combat system is quite a delicacy.;378;;;;;c;30654;264367
3357;;This game is mesmerizing and great for people who love exploration, which I am most definitely that individual. I have no issue shooting combatants in a game, but the Colossus are another story. People die and doing Dormins ( the necromancers) dirty work to bring them back has consequences. I am unable to choose my path and after running around exploring and killing the first Colossus, I knew this game had come to an end for me  I may only have one trophy for the game, but my empathy and ethics can live with this fact.

I have read way too many reviews that shoot this game down, and I completely disagree. In my opinion, the symbology between childhood and our aerial hero creates a deeper narrative for players.

3361;;Unfortunately the worst AC game (except AC games after unity, I consider only AC games before unity to compare). The only thing improved was the parkour movement. Combat controlls totally messed up, gear up too complicated and too expensive at beginning of the game, many many many bugs, player wont jump or climb where I want to jump or climb. The new movement feature of get cover behind objects is fully bugged 9/10 of times will lead to character getting stuck in a wall or in an object. Finally the AI is messed up, in many missions the patrols do not patrol realistic, too many guards make your assassin abilities useless because you simply cannot be stealthy enough to get unseen. Forget the old times where you could rape all enemies like a ninja with your hidden blades. If you dont want to alert guards, just stay on rooftops and throw berserker knives at the guards. Boring as f*ck. Furthermore the heavy weapons and the staffs are so slow, you cannot manage to perform an attach if you get attacked by 3 or more enemies. Really from AC 1 to AC Unity, Unity is the worst. I am giving 5 stars just because it is a part of the AC series. I am curious about Syndicate, its the next on my list...;5606;;BUGS BUGS BUGS, Overall movement is more buggy than games before, New movement feature cover behind objects lead to character getting stucked in objects or walls, AI messed up and too many enemies making stealth gameplay impossible.;;Parkour movement feature (especially parkour down);c;43279;265567
3362;I loved this game but if I had to be honest, I wish it had gone further and surprised us a bit more. Purist out there may disagree but I think they could have expanded the early parts of the game.;This is a near perfect remake. I still prefer the remake of the original game to this one for one simple reason. I think the original remake goes just a step further. They added in some interesting twists that elevated it a bit.

3363;I think Anthem is worth a look right now if you enjoy really fun combat. The reports of awful load times and the weird tethering system are grossly over exaggerated by haters. Theyre not that bad. Im serious. The story is so so, though its hard to follow because I was having too much fun shooting the shit with my buddies while we got into the zone of flying around like iron man and blasting aliens with our wizard powers and rocket launchers.;I think this game is getting a lot of undeserved flak. It has some glaring issues for sure. Most of which can and should be fixed eventually if EA doesnt give up on it too soon. The core gameplay experience is incredibly fun and addictive and for my money, was good enough to carry my through the campaign and several hours after. At this point there needs to be more of everything for this game. My main complaint is there are almost no cosmetic items. Looking cool in these games is important, and you can do a lot with the paint, but everyone has the same Javelins more or less. Let me be my own Javelin. Ive never played a game that I wanted to play so bad that weird design decisions frequently get in the way of me playing it.;36950;Anthem is a looter shooter similar to games like Destiny or The Division.

3364;;This DLC is really fantastic. The new story is fun, and the missions themselves are jam-packed with a huge variety of challenges, allowing players to try completely new things with the weapons that they have become familiar with from the base game. The new Octolings have a fantastic design, and the DLC also adds new lore, character development, and story to the main game. The levels offer ways to help if you are struggling with any challenges, but they also offer replayability in trying to complete certain challenges with different gear and in different amounts of time. In order to complete this DLC in full, it would be a big challenge, but a fun one. I would love to buy more DLC like this.;103364;;Need more hairstyles for Octolings sometime but this doesnt take away from the amazing DLC;;New levels, new lore, difficulty adjustment, replayability, new music, unlockable equipment, fun story;c;3392;266239
3365;;Uncharted 1- a great start to a thrilling series of run n gun style games, though this first one was a lot more about the gunning than I remembered.  It seriously seemed like one firefight after the other, the entire time.  There was almost NO treasure hunting/puzzling at all, but it was still a relatively enjoyable game regardless.  The sequels just make this one pale in comparison but you have to start somewhere, and this isnt a bad start by any stretch.

No longer just full of gunfight after gunfight, this game chugs along at a premium pace that few games can match.  And with the improvement in visuals and pretty much everything else regarding the production, it paints an amazing adventure that never slogs and is thrilling form start to finish.  No wonder its considered to be one of the best video games of all time.  I would pretty much agree, if there werent so many cheap deaths from too many bad guys, but dont want to have it be too easy I guess.  Amazing indeed.

Will say, felt more innovative than the second, implementing hand to hand combat better and mixing up the scenarios Drake goes through.

3370;;Played on original Japanese cartridge  saves with battery.  Your classic Super Mario game on the Game Boy. Unlike the first Mario Land where they tried to fit the scale of the NES onto the Game Boy, this time Nintendo went with large sprites which benefitted the game a lot better.  Wario has taken over Marios castle, and the bloke has locked the gate with 6 golden coins for you to find. The levels overall are simple in design, though the difficulty ramps up in a very soft curve through out except the very last level which is the castle itself, where it becomes a gauntlet to Warios room and duke it out within a single life. Although not too hard, it might be a little frustrating due to how running and jumping physics work.  Each golden coin is 1 world, finished off by a world boss. Each boss overall are easy, some might be more difficult to defeat mostly due to their odd patterns.  Overall the game is an enjoyable pick-up and play game whenever you have spare time to kill.;1071;;- Too few levels. - Should have been a bit more secrets. - Some levels are just too short, especially space world. - Overall a tad bit too easy.;;- Catchy soundtrack. - Tight controls as expected with a Super Mario title, though it might be some getting used to if coming from the console games. - Nice level design that fits the Game Boy.;c;39973;234970

The story was fascinating and the plot was long enough to enjoy the game. Weapon upgrades and player skills give a nice RPG feeling combined with badass Lara-action moves, really good adventure. Also many bonus content (galeries and videos) to unlock when playing through the game. The design of the characters and the environment was realistic and the overall grafics was a very good work. Finally the soundtrack gave me the chills, it fits very good to the game and makes it more adventurous.

3373;If Norse mythology is your thing, Jotun is absolutely worth the curiosity (its also quite short). It does tip toe on the epic and offers a wonderful canvas to look into. But as a game, it didnt feel particularly fun to play in my opinion.;Not long before starting Jotun i had just finished reading Neil Gaimans Norse Mythology, which is pretty ironic seeing how close the tales in the book and in this game intertwine. Long story short, i was pretty immersed from the get go when i started playing.   And immersion was there definitely, while the story is barebone the themes are deep and rich. All of which is supported by pretty and unique art and animation (i might debate that the animation has something to do with the gameplay issues). But.. a pretty and worthy canvas doesnt make it comfortable to play.   For a game that essentially is a boss rush, the gameplay mechanics are so.... sluggish. Thora is heavy, slow and incredibly limited in movements and abilities. Compare this to Hollow Knight, Bloodborne and the likes and this lags far behind, unfortunately. The fights just arent terribly enjoyable :( The game is divided in 5 bosses (+a final one), and to unlock each boss you need to go through 2 sub levels to collect runes. Level designs varied quite a lot and didnt always feel balanced unfortunately, some were definitely more enjoyable than others.;18149;My first impression of Jotun was that is looked better than it played.

Ive experienced absolutely no issues, bugs or crashes during my 3 week playing, this is extremely positive for an online based game.  7/10;What kept me playing this game is the absurd quantity of content this game has. It lets you create a character with faur amount of options and gives you simple instructions on how to do things. You get the main quest line with recommended level. Side missions, training modes with the existing dear DBZ characters, offlinemas battles, ranked online battles and defending the players hub against Freezas troops who periodically attack it.  The figthing feels good and easy to get in. New combinations and attacks are learnt through training modes and allow you to choose the progression rhythm and what attacks you want to include in your repertoire.  The thing that made me play it less and less was how childish and uncomplicated the game is. The story is ok but not really surprising or tense. The gameplay incentives button mashing instead of actual skill like in MKX for example. Although its make it easier to enjoy the whole thing, it quickly becomes quite unchallenging for experienced players.;19449;PS Plus has a lite version for free.

3382;The game does a lot well, but its unfortunate that From decided to stick to so many of their more tired mechanics and gameplay systems. I think that players who havent played the souls games, or at the very least are recent fans, will enjoy this more than those who have been playing FromSoft games since Demons Souls.;This game is very frustrating to me, and Im not meaning in terms of difficulty (though it is difficult). My first souls game was Demons souls, and I returned when Dark Souls 2 first came out, and Ive since gone and played all of the rest of them (Bloodborne too), and while I love those games (to varying degrees), I cant help but feel like theyve exhausted their lustre.  Sekiro is now the 6th FromSoftware game in a row to feature mechanics such as  bonfire checkpoints, no boss fight checkpoints, respawning enemies, tough boss fights, boss fight death fake-outs, occasional gimmick boss fights with no real challenge, NPCs with their own stories that only ever seem to progress while you arent looking, limited healing, shallow but visceral combat, as well as many many more. Dont get me wrong, a lot of these things have been improved, but that doesnt change the fact that, in the end, theyre all derivative of Dark/Demons Souls. Ive seen many people try and defend when this was the case in Bloodborne by calling it a genre, but I personally I think its a ridiculous claim. It isnt a genre, its just dark/demon souls all over again. You cant just copy yourself 5 times in a row and call it a genre, and if your response is to say that other genres do the same thing then youre provably wrong (Devil May Cry vs Ninja Gaiden, Metroid vs Castlevania, CS:GO vs Rainbow Six Siege, CoD vs Titanfall, etc.). One of the the reasons why Dark Souls 1 and Demons Souls were special and appealing to people was because they were very unique, and you couldnt experience what they had to offer elsewhere, but the constant sequels and spiritual sequels to them are retroactively ruining that appeal. All Im saying is, I dont want Dark Souls to become the next Assassins Creed  a model for lazy developers to copy over and over again until its been run into the dirt so hard that people start forgetting how good the original ones were, and how they pioneered the medium.  All that aside.. Positives and Negatives below:;76882;;No customisation or specialisation, especially in boss fights. All fights are done the same way, and the vast majority of main bosses must be fought head on with no opportunities for stealth or trickery. Inconsistent enemies. Some enemies will basically just sit there and let you style on them just by spamming basic attacks, while others are challenging enough that they may as well be mini-bosses. I get that varied enemies are important, but I believe this to be a flaw because of the rarity and importance placed upon some of these easier enemies. Repetitive boss fight fake-outs. The amount of bosses that pull the lol jk im not dead right after you kill them is staggering. I wont lie, its effective sometimes, but it gets annoying fast. Inconsistent hitboxes. If an enemy swings his sword and misses, but his elbow hits you  then you still take the full amount of damage as if the sword hit you. Its very blatant at times. Bad AI, very abusable Too many ranged enemies. Often times mini-bosses will be surrounded with ranged enemies that will almost certainly guarantee your death if you do not kill them first. This would be fine once or twice, but the fact that it happens so often can get very annoying. Currency is mostly useless during the first chunk of the game. Insane amount of repeat boss fights, especially mini-bosses. Boss gimmicks stolen from previous FromSoftware games. e.g., the supposed to lose fight at the start of the game.;48;New movement mechanics are flawed, but overall are good. The world and the lore is incredibly enthralling, and I found myself always wanting to learn more about it. Fantastic audio design and sound effects. Great voice acting. (for Japanese voices, which is the default voice language. I havent heard the English voices outside of the first announcement trailer, so I cant comment on them) Graphics are good, especially when it comes to the environments.

Before buying I thought I would not like the arts that much but the animation looked great on the trailer so I tried it. I ended up to love the art, the music, the gameplay, the atmosphere.   The first negative point is that when reaching 90% or above the game become insanely difficult for me. The second negative point is a region that is so well hidden that you can complete miss out of quite some great content.  But knowing that the cherry team kept giving awesome DLCs, and that the price was so cheap for ages compared to other games, I give it 100%.   Completely deserved.

3417;;Overall, this game was pretty easy to jump into and want to keep being pushed to want to finish it.  My real issues lie within the pacing of the game, which could be stilted and awkward at times with relatively large portions where you dont even have battles but do other types of activities like talk to people (which is kind of bizare for a Final Fantasy game).  A lot of people have a problem with the junction system being to convoluted or cumbersome, but honestly if you just embrace it from the start it becomes pretty nice to utilize the entire time- makes you feel like you have a pretty good handle on beefing up your characters without having to grind.  In the end, I enjoyed the story and only thought some parts were handled not quite the smoothest, but either way the epic scale of the story makes it feels meaningful and for the most part the characters were endearing.  Plus the visuals and music were pretty astounding for the PS1.  Certainly not the worst Final Fantasy game by any stretch.

Roundabout beskrivs som ett spel inspirerat av b-filmer från 1970-talet. Du plockar upp passagerare som ger dig uppdrag, eller körningar, i vissa fall av dödsföraktande karaktär. Allt kryddat med en kärlekshistoria. Och så dyker det upp en ”svensk” passagerare.  Mellansekvenserna är filmade både ur din, eller rättare sagt chauffören, Georgio Manos, vinkel och från passagerarnas. Krystade dialoger, eller rättare sagt monologer då Manos uteslutande använder ansiktsmimik för att förmedla känslor, höjer underhållningsvärdet.  Dessutom blandas det in några actionsekvenser, biljakter tagna rakt ur filmerna som inspirerat till den handling som spelet driver med.   Stillbilder är inte bästa sättet att illustrera en ständigt snurrande limo. Men det är ändå en utmaning att ta sig fram på en enkel parkeringsplats. Foto: No Goblin Stillbilder är inte bästa sättet att illustrera en ständigt snurrande limo. Men det är ändå en utmaning att ta sig fram på en enkel parkeringsplats. Men det som gör det till ett spel i sin egen rätt är mekaniken. Din limousin är ett ständigt snurrade fordon. Och kör du in i för många hinder exploderar den.  Roundabout är förlåtande, och du återuppstår snabbt vid närmsta verkstad eller delmål om du spelar ett uppdrag. Och är du lika oskicklig som jag blir det många krascher innan du reder ut spelet. Ändå blir det aldrig tjatigt, och efter några försök går det att reda ut alla situationer i huvudhistorien.  Värre är det att samla alla hemliga samlarsaker som är utspridda i staden, som heter just Roundabout (cirkulationsplats på svenska, för rondell är ju som bekant platsen i mitten och inget annat...). Det är en öppen värld där det gäller att snurra sig fram runt hindren.  Efter ett tag kan ditt fordon även hoppa, vilket tar spelet, och snurrigheterna, till nya höjder. Foto: No Goblin Efter ett tag kan ditt fordon även hoppa, vilket tar spelet, och snurrigheterna, till nya höjder. Efter ett tag låser du upp förmågan att hoppa med bilen, och en del saker blir enklare samtidigt som nya utmaningar väntar.  Roundabout är tillräckligt kort för att det inte ska bli tjatigt, och tillräckligt långt för att den som uppskattar mekaniken ska bli ordentligt utmanad.  Det också en mängd olika kosmetiska och spelmekaniska förändringar att låsa upp. Nya ljud, extra stora huvuden på stadens invånare, en bläckfisk på taket eller förmågan att byta riktning på snurrandet piggar upp. Och den närmast oändliga mängd ordskämt kring rotation som levereras av berättarrösten ger en extra twist...  Det gick drygt två år mellan No Goblins första och andra spel, det innebär att det snart borde vara dags för nummer tre. Och det finns ett twitterkonto med namnet ”No Goblin Game 3”. Inläggen är få, och väcker fler frågor än svar. Men det kan inte bli annat än intressant när utvecklaren skriver saker som ”har lagt till hundar, du kan nu klappa hundarna”, ”hundar fastnar inte längre i folks byxor” och ”fixade orealistisk bugg där hundar slutar äta varmkorv om du klappade dem”...;15852;;A bit short;;Gameplay Music;c;40466;256240

3425;;This game is truly a masterpiece from the age of bold experimentation in video game development. It peculiarly combines traits of RTS and point-and-click adventure in a crazy-ish fictional setting through a set of pre-rendered maps, of which every one is a visually unique island, containing a special location granting insight into story of the setting. It is still a game worth playing even in the present day, and I highly advise that you do.;73709;;;;Music, SFX, visuals, mechanics.;c;33098;270672
3426;;Im not going to lie, I think Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is, quite possibly, my favorite game From Software has made, beating even the all mighty original Dark Souls. These are two games that begin very much in the same way, a foreboding sense of loneliness and hopelessness enshrouding the everything the game offers. But soon, after the first couple of hours, Sekiro begins demanding a type of focus and attention the DS series never asked or required. Surely, this makes it a more niche experience than any DS, but for any player willing to stick with it, the game will reward him/her with some of the most viciously demanding and highly satisfying gameplay loops you can experience in a game, today. Add to this the richly detailed world-building and narrative inventiveness From Software is so well regarded for, along with a captivating main narrative, top-notch production values in both visuals and sound, and you get another five finger death punch of a game that will make you tear out your hair, all the while making you say just one more try.;76882;;;;;c;30654;271525
3427;;Ill never forget this game.  It came at a time when my family had little to no money.  I remember going to a Toys R Us and buying one of those 100 game packs with money I have been saving up.  I believe it came with just a demo but that was enough for hours upon hours of game time for me and my little brother.  This would be our first RTS game and we loved it.  We would try all kinds of different strategies and loved matching up different type of units.  One of our favorite things to do was to see how long we could last on the map with a strictly defensive strategy.  After playing it for a while, we begged my parents to buy it for us.  Once we bought the full version, we played it and worked on completing the campaign.  I dont know if we ever completed it but I had so much fun playing the skirmishes.  I havent played it since that time but plan on picking it up soon on GOG.  I would recommend it.;9691;;;;;c;7553;272108
3428;;Its an interesting story, but a lot of driving and the shooting is a bit clunky.

3429;;One of the best superhero themed video games of all time. The game is incredibly simple when compared to its sequels but in retrospect its simplicity is what gives it its charm.

3432;;Terrible, Boring, and Worthless trash that I wish my parents never bought for me. I have a little story, when I was 9, me and my younger sister wanted a Poptropica game for the 3DS, when we got one, we were utterly disappointed, the game soon restarted by itself and thats when me and my sister called it  quits.  The game is extremely easy, so easy in fact that the items appear a couple of steps ahead of you. The game is also extremely boring, you dont want to find out where the other artifacts are. The game give you a lack of directions, so you can easily be lost, like you have to leave the borders to get to the next island but I had no idea because of the sense of directions. He game even wastes your time by giving you islands where you can do mini missions for coins, but coins are extremely easy to get so whats the point? But the game does look alright for the 3DS and customizing your character can be fun, but thats not going to save the game.;85348;;Its way to easy Its boring Sometimes not showing you the way to go Stupid mini islands that no one cares about;;Graphics look alright Customizing your character can be fun;c;46522;273601
3433;;A puzzle game with puppies for all ages.  80 challenging levels for the brain to move. Levels with quite varied and colorful. Easy to understand the mechanics of the game, each Pup in his bowl where can help each other to reach there bowl.  For those who like to hunt achievements this game is easy to get them, hunt all the hams in order to unlock special levels to complete the achievements list.  The only negative I found in this game was the background music that becomes very repetitive.  Anyone who likes a good puzzle regardless of age no doubt i recommend it.;29812;;- Repetitive music;;- Gradual difficulty - Cute Graphics - Many hams to collect - Easy achievement;Hams everywhere!!!;46649;273969
3434;;I must say this game was how I met the Corrosion projects. The Japanese theme is something that always interested and the fact that you can be the leader of a rebellion, create my own character led me to buy this game.  The game is an open world in which it gives the player a main objective, but not only, as long as the player will explore the map world other places will be unlocked, having side quests, recruit companions, etc.  With this the player will gain fame and resources in which he will have to make decisions for the most part based on his leadership of an army being able to transmit command of policies and constructions of commissions.  The battle system in my opinion is well balanced (but not for all tastes) can be a bit frustrating at first but with the right choice of various skills the frustrating will ends up soon.  The weapons and armor are quite decent, being some better than others, bearing in mind that some weapons and armor is necessary to unlock the Skill to be able to use. The weapons and armor have durability so it is necessary to repair from time to time.  The soundtrack of the game has a touch of Japanese music which I loved.  What I missed in this game was a more elaborate plot. But apart from that I think the game is pretty polished, given that it uses rpg maker software.  For those who appreciate the genre I recommend the purchase.;32476;;- More elaborate Main Story;;- Good variety of customizer the character of the player - Vast open world - Various Quest - Balanced battle system - Many companions - Lead your rebellion group - Good soundtrack;c;46649;273970

3442;;TL DR  This game feels like it was made in the 1990’s… and I love that.  General Thoughts  As a JRPG fan who grew up in the 90’s, Square Enix’s SNES and PS1 era JRPGs were a huge part of my childhood. Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IX are two of my favorite games of all time. Suffice to say, I’m a sucker for games that cater towards this nostalgia.With that being said, my experience with “I am Setsuna” so far is everything I could have wanted or expected from a game like this. “I am Setsuna” is by no means the best game of 2016, but if you go in expecting to experience what it’s like to play your favorite 90’s JRPG for the first time again, you’re in for a treat.  The good  Music  My words would not do the music any justice, just listen. The music in this game, consisting mostly of solo piano pieces, is haunting, full of emotion, and absolutely carries the game. The soundtrack has an amplification effect on all aspects of the game. The characters, settings, story events, even the gameplay all feel more “full” due to tracks that perfectly set the tone throughout the game.  Gameplay  While the gameplay isn’t exactly deep or challenging so far, it is still very satisfying. The battle system is very similar to that of Chrono Trigger, while the equipment/skill system is similar to Final Fantasy VII. Skills aren’t acquired through levels, they are acquired by combining loot obtained from monsters. The way the drop/loot system works is genius and something that I wish more JRPGs would try to emulate. There are no random drops from enemies, instead, enemies drop items when you satisfy certain conditions with the way you defeat them. If you satisfy multiple conditions, you will get all of the items for the conditions that you satisfied. For example, if you defeat an enemy with a powered up lightning based attack, then you will get two drops from the enemy: one for defeating them with a powered up attack and one for defeating them with a lightning based attack. Random drops are extremely frustrating  This system feels like a breath of fresh air for the JRPG genre.  Scale  The game oozes “small budget production” in almost every aspect of the game, but this is a good thing. The budget (or lack thereof) forced various design decisions throughout the game. The developers didn’t have the budget for an overwhelmingly amount of side quests to distract you from the surprisingly personal story of sadness and suffering that this game tells. The developers didn’t have the budget to populate the world with hundreds of NPCs in tens of towns, so they created a small world with personality. I appreciate the fact that I won’t have to invest large amount of time to experience all that this game has to offer.  The not so good  There’s not much that I don’t like about the game. I’m very satisfied with every aspect of “I am Setsuna” at its core. However, the game is not perfect and there are a few things that I think could have improved the game. I consider the below points nitpicks about an otherwise great game.  Setting  All of the environments I’ve reached in the game so far can be described as “snowy, wooded, wasteland”, and I don’t see this changing much for the rest of the game. While I do like the general graphics and art style and how the setting matches the tone of the story, I can only handle so much snow. I think the town and dungeon design is fine  I enjoy exploring all of the environments in the game (mainly because that means I get more time to listen to the soundtrack). However, instead of thinking “Nice, a new dungeon/town! Can’t wait to explore it!”, I find myself thinking “oh… another icy/snowy town/dungeon…”.  Menus/UI theme  This complaint arises from my complaint about the setting. The main menu which is used to manage items, skills, equipment, party, etc. has a sort of “gray, arctic” theme. This is fine, looks great, and the UX of the menu is pretty good. However, because most of the game takes place in a snowy environment, the menu tends to blend into the surroundings. It can be hard to navigate the menu in certain areas of the game due to the colors blending in to the background.  No Attack Range Indicators  In battle, many attacks and skills are targeted at an enemy, but affect an area around the enemy. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t show you the range of the attack you are using. This means you will often be asking yourself, “I’m targeting enemy A, is enemy B close enough to be hit by this?” and you will often be wrong. If the game were actually difficult, this would be a huge problem, but as it is, this is just a minor annoyance.;18861;;;;;c;28559;274298
3443;A super chill game that looks pretty and fun because it doesnt have a goal;(Review from a month after the game released, not to date to recent game updates)  TL DR  A super chill game that looks pretty and fun because it doesnt have a goal  General Thoughts  So most people were VERY upset about this game  because it was really hyped up by gaming media, the developers talked it up like it was going to change gaming forever, and many people felt like the developers promised features that didnt actually end up in the game. I dont and didnt care about any of this. I played the game with basically zero knowledge about it basically because coworker suggested it to me. With zero expectations, the game was pretty amazing. It honestly made me feel like no other game has made me feel - the sense of exploration, discovery, loneliness.  The Good  Graphics/Art  I really like the art style. The stylized graphics make me think that this game will look good for a while. The game is very colorful, which is a nice breath of fresh air. The style of the plants and animals allow for some interesting looking things  Sense of Scale  The game feels very big, and it does really make you feel like you are in the universe and theres actually a whole universe for you to explore. That being said, the actual planets felt pretty underwhelming, until you install the big animals/plants mods. With these, the game feels awesome, since you can land on planets with giant spiders and large forests and it makes you feel small.  The Not So Good  Repetitiveness  After about 10ish hours of playing the game, it felt pretty repetitive. Finding a new planet and seeing the same deer/blob/crab thing but with just a slight modification will get boring after a while. If there were more variety in the game, it would be more interesting for long: more animal variety, more planet geography variety, maybe different biomes on a single planet.;3225;;Repetitiveness;;Graphics/Art  Sense of Scale;c;28559;274299
3444;One of the best modernized SNES-era-JRPGs out there. Comes very close to a masterpiece, but falls just short.;TL DR  One of the best modernized SNES-era-JRPGs out there. Comes very close to a masterpiece, but falls just short.  General Thoughts  This is everything I wanted FFXV to be. This game is a shining example of how to take an SNES-era style JRPG, bring it up to date with modern JRPG mechanics and mix in a few Western-RPG game mechanics. Its a perfect mix of charming story telling from Dragon Quest, Sprite/Character art from SNES-era Final Fantasy, Press-turn-like battle system from Shin Megami Tensei, and Class system from Bravely Default. It may seem like I wrote a lot about what I didnt like, but this is I enjoyed the game so much and found that it did things so well that it was obvious to point out where it fell flat.  The Good  Graphics and art style  Im always a fan of very stylized graphics/art style (Wind Waker, DQ8), as I believe these hold up much better than standard graphics/art style. The character sprites look great, monster and boss art is interesting, environments are beautiful.  Battle system  The battle system as a whole is really satisfying. While I do think it is a step down from Bravely Default, I still think its a great take on a modern turn based system. The boost/break system allows for some really challenging and almost puzzle-like boss fights - where you have to balance between using your BP to break the boss faster or save it to deal out the most damage after you break the boss.  Quest system  As someone who gets overwhelmed by all the quests and collect-a-thons in modern console games (Wither 3, Assassins Creed, Horizon Zero Dawn), I found it really refreshing how bare bones the quest system is. I love that theres no way points to lead me to the next step in the quest. I love that you actually have to read what the NPCs are saying to know what to do for the quest. I love that you have to think about which characters field ability you have to use to solve a particular quest.  Class system  Im a sucker for games with classes (like FF5, DQ7, Bravely Default, Etrian Odyssey) and this game does not disappoint. Theres not as many classes as in something like Bravely Default, and you cant customize each character as much (you can only change their sub class and 4 passives), but the classes are well balanced and each one is useful in battle in some way. Theres still enough customization that you can build your party to defeat challenging bosses in different ways to capitalize on your partys synergies.  The Not So Good  No overarching or central plot  Story-wise, the main problem with the game is that there is not really a central plot. The driving force of the game comes from the players interest in the 8 mini-stories. The mini-stories are not terrible, but they are not great - and most definitely not on par with even the side stories of characters in games like FFVI or DQ7. For people who value a great narrative, I could see how this could be a huge turnoff. Unless people are drawn to the gameplay mechanics, I imagine most people will just complete the stories of the few characters they like.  Main characters dont interact in a meaningful way  Plot and character interaction often go hand-in-hand. The fact that there is no central story to bring all these characters together means that they dont have the chance to have arcs together. The force of change in each character is the series of events that happen to them in their mini-stories. There are some mini-scenes similar in form to skits from the Tales series, but they are often only between two characters, we never learn anything new about the characters, and even the characters dont really learn anything new from these interactions.  No boosting into debt  You start off each battle with 1 BP and you can only boost by as much BP you have. This is my main major complaint with the battle system. I really wish that they would have taken the Brave/Default system from Bravely Default. This makes random encounters a slog, since you cant just 4x boost every character and defeat the enemies in one turn as you can in Bravely Default.  No encounter rate slider  One thing that I really would have loved is some way to completely turn off the random encounters - ideally the encounter rate slider from the Bravely Series. There is a character ability to reduce the encounter rate, but I really wish that I could get rid of them completely. I enjoy the environments so much that I really would have liked to walk between most locations, but I found myself fast travelling to avoid random encounters.  No beastiary  Theres really no excuse for a modern JRPG to not have a beastiary of some sort. Its good that the enemies have their weaknesses displayed under them in battle, but I would have preferred an in game compendium containing more info about each enemy.  The way Haanit talks  One of the 8 characters talks in what seems like an attempt at Old English(?) and it just makes things harder to understand and adds nothing to the character. Its enough to make me never use her in my party and only begrudgingly go through her chapters.  End game battles rely on RNG too much  (Note: Im just getting to the end game, so I may come back and update this)  My main complaint is with how the end game treats physical attackers. So the general strategy against bosses is this: attack their weakness until they break, then unload all your damage. The quickest way to break bosses is with many attacks. The only good passive skills that align with this strategy for a physical attacker are Second Serving (50% chance to attack again after a basic attack) and Patience (25% chance to act again at the end of a turn). The other way a physical attacker can perform multiple attacks is though boost-attacking or using multi-attack skills like Thousand Spears or Arrowstorm but these attacks often miss - even with accuracy boosting buffs. This makes fighting bosses very frustrating as Ive often found myself failing to break a boss when I was planning to because RNG made me miss more than I expected, or Ive been able to save myself by randomly getting an extra action. Living/dying by RNG is never satisfying to me;26765;;No overarching or central plot  Main characters dont interact in a meaningful way  No boosting into debt  No encounter rate slider  No beastiary  The way Haanit talks;130;Graphics and art style  Battle system  Quest system  Class system;c;28559;274300
3445;;Its a very interesting game with a great mechanic. Some of the levels are on the right difficulty, but for others it is really unclear how to solve them. If you do eventually give up and look up the answer my response was mostly how was I suppose to know that rather than man Im an idiot. Though there are also great moments when you discover the unique ways in which you can solve a puzzle.;76638;;;;;c;35434;275222
3446;;Based on PS4 Version  The one thing that really surprised me this time going through this game was how DIFFICULT the ending stages were, like pretty damn tricky.  The presentation is probably the best youll see form a PS1 game and thats probably the stand out point of it.  The real thing that holds this game back from being TRULY amazing (like FF7 or 6) is that it is WAY too slow paced.  The battles especially just slog the game down from the beginning, so much so that if I wasnt playing this on the PS4 version where I could speed things up I may not have wanted to play through it again.  Otherwise, the characters were well written and fleshed out, the scenario while somewhat cliche was only taking from and homaging what came before and it works very well.  In the end, a very enjoyable game that desperately needed to be sped up all around.

3447;;Great game. Its very fun if youre crossing stealth. The system of gaining and losing perks from the fact that you are noticed is remarkable.

It is conceived as a stealth game and is remarkable in that.;90083;;Nothing;;Graphics. Gameplay. Atmosphere.;c;41147;275874
3448;;Its an automatic huge step down because its online. Lets face it, it cheapens it. It takes you out of it. Then we have the vastness of it, which is both good and bad. More quests, yes. But better? No. Nowhere near. Quantity over quality. If you thought exploring tombs in Skyrim was boring, you are in for a grave. Every tomb, cave, dungeon or whatever, looks the same. It literally has the same layout. There are A LOT of pointless enemies, theyre all too boring and too difficult (in a way where I just dont want to spend ANY time on them). Hordes of zombies, spiders and bees. No thank you.  And what is the upside of having it online? No one interacts with each other anyway. Some people randomly duel other people because they are bored. The PVP section is laggy and buggy. Crashes a lot. On top of that, you are FORCED to team up with other people for some dungeons, world bosses and other things. Because they are impossible to do on your own.   There just arent enough decent characters in it. I only ever felt for 2 characters throughout the entire game (all three factions). Most of them are empty shells.  The stories are a bit repetitive and boring. Its the same endgame for the main story and for the faction main story basically. And similar for Fighters Guild. Thieves Guild is an uninspiring version of the Skyrim one. Mages guild is ok but ultimately pointless.   Then we come to the worst part. The customization of your character. Its all very locked up and you have to pay real money for pretty much anything even half-cool. Most of its still shit. There are a few gems but its just not worth it. I cant spend $15 on a fucking in-game outfit. Thats mad. And the in-game economy is broken. You cant buy anything decent for a reasonable price in-game. Not from merchants and not from other players.  ESO plus is $10 a month and then you have to buy clothes, mounts, houses and all other sorts of things. Not to mention DLCs that arent even included for ESO plus users. People who pay $10 EVERY MONTH FOR YEARS. Bethesda are greedy and tasteless. And are these ESO plus players allowed to edit their characters hair even? NO. Thatll cost you 10$ just like for everybody else. Want 2 outfit slots? Same thing there. Want to change your skill points? Add a tattoo? Get a house? Same thing.  Oh and the graphics feel like 15 year old game.   So what is good about this game, you ask? The world. Tamriel. The world building and the lore. Thats it. But as a game, its actually shit and Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves.;1081;;The graphics Most of the quests The fact that its online EXPENSIVE (ESO plus, DLCs, mounts, clothes, etc. etc. etc. etc.;;The World-building The Lore Some of the characters (Naryu/Razum-Dar);c;47027;277083
3449;;Cheap, terrible rip-off of NFS: Underground (perhaps with a bit of Midnight Club in it). The studio who developed this game is really unheard of and little to no people know about this game.  I played the demo of this game when I was a child and compared to the final game, its not all that different...  It lacks on many aspects.   The story is your typical racing game one that only serves to give the player a slight meaning to what they are doing. The soundtrack was made custom for the game but is comprised of only a few WAVs that loop over and over again. The gameplay has two modes, a racing mode and a free-roam mode. The racing very plain and simple, nothing special. The free-roam is pretty cool considering the map but there is nothing to do on the city. The game interface is weird, it looks like there wasnt much effort put into it. The graphics fit the time but look a bit outdated. The cars are... If I remember well, very few. There are ridiculously advanced details about the cars mechanics. PSI stuff and a couple other things I can not remember very well. The customization wasnt all that bad, there were dozens of vinyls and some mechanical stuff too. The map is cool, it seems to be a recreation of Los Angeles, I like that while its simple it has detail and looks flashy. The only problem is that there are roads that lead to nowhere with Xs on them, Its really weird. The cutscenes that tell that story look pretty interesting and have quite detailed models and characters, not bad to look at.  On an overall the game looks unfinished with only a few good things to note.;47335;;Lacks car options Gameplay is a bit boring Looks unfinished Lacking soundtrack Empty free-roam;;The map while simple has a decent size and an interesting design, its definitely the best part of the game.  Specific car details for every model, decent customization. Detailed CGI cutscenes.;c;47057;277182
3450;;Honestly there isnt much you can say bad about this game, though I do believe that it starts out more interesting than it ends.  The combat is revolutionary even by todays standards, its incredibly fun to explore the world and solve the puzzles, and its all set in the Batman universe in a way that almost no previous Batman game was able to accomplish.  Still fantastic to play all these years later, and probably gets a little overshadowed by the fact that Arkham City is even better by comparison.  Stellar game either way.

3453;;While the production of this game was STELLAR for the time that it came out, and pretty much today as well, the story and characters in it left something to be desired.  The voice acting was… bad, just bad, and the overall understanding of just what the hell is going on is totally ambiguous for the most part.  The one saving grace is that its short, relatively easy (though can be frustratingly cheap at times), and moves briskly through its mostly shallow narrative.  Fun to play though, and has really cool systems of upgrading weapons that I wish more games implemented.  Decent in the end.

But they are too irritating, and not funny or charismatic.  -Too much dialogues (Specially from characters. OKAY, I UNDERSTOOD the joke or steriotype of the character the first time you showed it)  -Bad history (Its decent. But when you bring a lot of expectation to it, because of the fanbase, it becomes worse than it is).;;-Revolutionary gameplay system, where you dont need to fight monsters to win.  -A lot of moments that break the forth barrier (Specially the final battle, that was trully genious of Toby Fox)   -A great sountrack, with a lot of varieties and no musics with loops.;c;42031;279502
3458;;Kingdom Hearts 3 is a game hardcore fans of the series have waited for and for a very long time, I should add. I havent reviewed the other games since I mostly want to replay them in order to give them a fair rating since I havent played them in a long time. This is going to be a somewhat fleshed out review of the game as a whole. I have played every single game entry of the series (minus the phone game and most of Union X) so I have a good understanding of the plot. With that being said, lets move forward.  To begin with, I want to address the gameplay. I want to talk about plot but I have quite a bit to say about it so Ill talk about that later. The gameplay itself is fun and when I say fun I dont mean I could do this for hours kinda fun. Once you begin your trek across the Disney worlds, your moveset gets pretty outlandish. You learn how to use attraction flows which is basically another way for Disney to advertise their hand in making this game. The flows wouldnt be a problem if they were like summons and werent thrown in your face. Instead, a reaction command pops onto your screen for like 24 seconds urging you to bash your already easy enemies into oblivion. Additionally, Soras keyblade transformations can make the game so ridiculously easy. They arent earned in a way that make them interesting, either. You simply string countless combos together mindlessly until a reaction command appears for you. Granted, the attractions and transformations are cool, but they really should have considered balancing the game so that Sora doesnt feel like an unstoppable force of nature. With those things aside, basic combat is fun. Just like the other main titles, you learn abilities from leveling up that enhance basic combos into longer ones or more flashy ones. Magic looks pretty and has its place in the game and you can make builds that make you more powerful in whatever way you want.  Moving on to visuals, this game looks so nice. In every world Sora, Donald, and Goofy never look too out of place. The lighting is fantastic and beyond anything I could have imagined after coming out of Kingdom Hearts DDD. The cinematics draw you into whats happening as you wander through the Disney worlds and sometimes it even seems like youre watching the Disney movies unfold in the universe of Kingdom Hearts.  *SPOILERS AHEAD*  Finally, the story is one of the biggest hindrances of this game. Now, for the sake of making the review not stick out as a 20 page essay on why the writing in Kingdom Hearts is an absolute mess, Ill focus on 3. Starting off with the overall story of the series and how 3 plays into it, I have to say that Nomura and Yasue really screwed the pooch with this game. Over every different game on every platform it was released, new characters have been introduced that get incomplete arcs and no resolution. I refer to the trio in both BBS and Days as well as Namine, and I was really hoping this game was going to put a nice bow on everything that this series tried exposing us to in previous games. As I played the game, I realized KH3 was a big marketing scheme for Disney to promote their movies, as over half of it is Sora and the crew running through Disney worlds in an effort to learn his lost power of Waking. Nothing relevant to the Square Enix plot of KH3 is even happening throughout your journey into Disney worlds, save for when members of the new organization call Sora a nerd and leave after a two minute monologue at the end of them. The writing was one of the most underwhelming aspects of this game, as it fails to complete story arcs in a way that satisfies the fans and the original story it seems like it was trying to tell. The only real interesting part of this game is the end, where Nomura and Yasue go nuts and tell the story they obviously wanted to tell since the beginning of the game. Its cool but its so overly rushed that you cant enjoy whats happening in the moment because youre fighting off multiple people at once, like some kind of KH dream gauntlet youd read about in a fanfic. I wish I could say that Im satisfied with the handling of every character, but I just am not. Most of the character development was poured into Axel, which isnt completely bad but in a series where youre managing a group of technically main characters it seems like youre just throwing them into situations while they learn almost nothing from it. Kairi is a big example of this, and at this point Im pretty sure Nomura just doesnt know how to write for Kairi. At the end of DDD, Kairi was shown learning how to use the keyblade at the end with her training extending all the way through most of KH3. Her and Axel dont really leave training until its time for them to rally against Xehanort and his darknesses. Just when you think shell be useful again, she gets absolutely shafted. When I say shafted, I mean she hardly holds her own and is used yet again as motivation rather than a character that could be useful. Xehanort literally just snatches her and kills her so that Sora will fight him. At the end of the day Xehanort, the guy that literally commits murder and tears apart worlds as well as uses people as tools, gets the I was just a curious person cover and rides off into Kingdom Hearts with Eraqus. Thats really how it ends.  Well there it is. I said I was going to be unbiased but there are definite points that needed to be personally addressed. I am a hardcore fan and a lot of my thoughts on this game were personal. I hope I wasnt too harsh but if I wrote about everything I loved and hated about the game and talked about it, you guys would be looking at about ten pages of content.;2933;;;48;;Review: Kingdom Hearts III;47433;279545
3459;;I finally got around to fully playing this game after having it on my Switch for about a year...  I really liked it. Sort of reminded me of Gone Home & Life is Strange.

Its an epic story about heroes and building competitions, or something.  Maybe its fun for young kids, but as an adult Minecraft player Im probably not in the target audience.  Even so, I dont see how the long sequences of pointless dialogue could be fun for anyone.;8339;;Youd think a game called Story Mode would have more of a story to it.;;Looks like Minecraft, which is cool for super fans that like anything block-shaped.;c;47510;279799

3464;;This is one of the first games I remember playing. The nostalgia is intense! I built a physical shufflepuck table in my room with a friend - it didnt work well and the satisfying crash of a score was missing.

Its fantastic how much character the artists managed to wring from the few available pixels.;12222;;Measured by todays standards, game play is not exceptional but it still kind of works.;;This is a game with surprising depth.

3465;;Super addicting and fun game with tons and tons of spells and combinations to make. Cute pixel graphics (upon closer inspection the pixels arent that at all, but it looks nice so who cares), great bosses, cool gear system. Its just really fun. The mechanics are solid. Unfortunately, the music is a resounding meh, the bosses are somewhat uninspired, the story doesnt exist, the shop gives no spell descriptions before buying, the game is awfully short without replaying it, the enemy variety is lacking, and the systems are often confusing at first (however they do become fun once you figure them out). The game just kinda lacks soul. But overall, its still pretty fun, so I give it a pretty fair rating.;19935;;Uninspired, lack of content, very grindy;;Addicting, fun, nice visuals, solid mechanics;c;47537;280166
3466;;A solid entry to the 3D Zelda series, but not without its caveats.   OPENING Twilight Princess features what is essentially a double opening - one to introduce you to Link, the Hero of Twilight, and another to display the best (which admittedly isnt much) of his new wolf form. While it appears to many to be a slog, I am of the opinion that it opens the game near-perfectly, balancing the two forms while making an opening still better than the pain that was Skyward Swords opening hours.   STYLE Twilight Princesss more somber and muddled atmosphere is a knee-jerk reaction to the negative attention brought to The Wind Wakers cartoon cel-shading. Its a love-it-or-hate-it, controversial style, and while it accurately reflects the games tone, it remains drab and colorless sans a few dungeons and hidden areas. The GameCube-realism style has also aged quite awfully.  OVERWORLD Hyrule is more packed than ever before, with enemies left and right, Epona combat on a new level, a bustling Castle Town area, and puzzles scattered all around. Unfortunately, the grass textures are boring and lame, somewhat remedied by the standout and memorable Field theme. Theres not much to do as Wolf Link, however, which seems to be a trend throughout the game. The Tears of Light are too abundant and tend to miss their point (introducing the player to a new area), instead becoming a bit boring and tedious.  DUNGEONS Link adventures through several of the seriess best dungeons - Lakebed Temple showing off a surprisingly complex interconnected spinning staircase puzzle, Arbiters Grounds uniquely using the Wolf form for a Poe hunt and the underappreciated Spinner to ride around the dungeon, Snowpeak Temple and City in the Sky displaying new mechanics with excellent atmosphere, and Hyrule Castle tying each mechanic together in a great tie-up to the game. The other dungeons, while less notable, are still stellar for the most part despite getting a bit caught up in the Zelda formula.  ENEMIES and BOSSES Twilight Princess is NOT difficult. Despite this, it has excellent enemy variety (a nice compliment to Breath of the Wilds bland Bokoblin, Moblin, Bokoblin, Moblin pattern) showcased just by the mere presence of the Bulblins, enemies that appear only once more (in the often neglected Spirit Tracks). Most enemies are creatively designed to fit with the games more realistically textured atmosphere while using attack patterns that bring out the best of Links expanded combat capabilities - my favorite example being the Darknuts. On the topic of bosses, while not very difficult, the designs are stunning and unique. Stallord, Blizzeta, Zant, and the many phases of Ganondorf, while (again) not difficult make up for it in just how darn fun they are. Unfortunately, there are Morpheel and Diababa, who flop. The minibosses are great as well, my favorites being Death Sword (for his use of Wolf Link) and Skull Kid.  COMBAT Link: Awesome. Wolf Link: Meh, okay. Link sports many Hidden Skills that he can learn from his Ocarina of Time ancestor throughout the game that are fun to use and fun to watch unfold. Theyre more interactive than Wind Wakers skills, thankfully. Wolf Link, on the other hand, sees some nice use with scents and Poes, but otherwise feels a bit too cheesy and forced in. Hes never really given a time to shine.  ITEMS Twilight Princess boasts awesome items that are sometimes underutilized. The Double Clawshot (an improvement on the Clawshot in every way), Ball and Chain(very unique, utilized well in Snowpeak but not much else), Dominion Rod (much better than The Wind Wakers statue song), Hawkeye, Gale Boomerang, and Spinner (famously underutilized, but its actually not!) are all seriously fun and creative all while feeling Zelda-authentic. Id love to see these items expanded on more in a future Zelda title. Too bad the Horse Call is obtained too late-game.  MUSIC The compositions are awesome, memorable, and evoke all the right emotion, but are slapped in the face by a vaguely-MIDI soundfont as opposed to actual orchestration. Its fine in some places, its not in others. Thankfully, the compositions are great enough that its great to listen to anyway.  STORY This is where Twilight Princess distinguishes itself. The devs ditch the annoying companions for Midna, who has a real and tangible character arc and isnt annoying. Zelda, while serving as a key character who brings on some tear-jerking moments midgame, serves as more of a Triforce-obligation as Midna takes center stage. While I wont spoil every detail, the story of Twilight Princess is highlighted by memorable characters (who unfortunately have ugly, disproportional faces. sorry Malo) and memorable enemies. One amazing ongoing theme is Links feud with King Bulblin, who appears to cause trouble numerous times. The big bad seems to be the outcast Twili dictator Zant, who wishes to take Hyrule for his own and cast a twilight shadow over the land. However, halfway through the game it is revealed that Zant is being manipulated by none other than Ganondorf, the King of Thieves himself. This is a very widely criticized plot twist, often cited as happening at the end of the game and for ruining a perfectly good villain (Zant). I disagree entirely, with the former claim being untrue (Ganondorf was shown as early as the Arbiters Grounds) and the latter being misguided - Zants manipulation is a key part of his character, just as his shift to insanity was (an equally criticized and controversial move). However, I feel that Zants crazy streak was foreshadowed at Lakebed and differentiates him from every other super serious and super evil villain. Evil dudes are about flaws, and Zants flaw is his ambition for power that hell never be able to use properly and his wish for revenge against some imagined wrong against him. These flaws arent really seen too much in games. While some say the Twilight Palace scene makes Zant look like a manbaby, I say it shows his true character - a lunatic, a fanatic, and someone who knows that he is done for and only tries to use the last of his power - but fails, as always. Plus, he gets some redemption at the end by snapping his own neck to kill off Dorf for good!  MISC Link is buff. There is a real recipe for Superb Soup. Henas fishing hut is hilarious and very Nintendo-esque.;1036;;Outdated visuals, easy difficulty, underutilized mechanics, bad soundfont, controversial story choices.;;Fabulous story, combat, design, items and dungeons. Busy Hyrule, fun bosses, great music, controversial story choices!;c;47537;280174
3467;;HD REMAKE NOTES This remake gives Twilight Princess a much-needed fresh coat of modern paint and adds some bonus functionality. As a remake, its alright, but the game as a whole is much improved. Visuals are retextured and bloom is reduced, leaving the style up to personal opinion. Human -> Wolf switching is streamlined and the Wii U touchscreen menus are a gift. The Wolf Link amiibo, who comes with the physical edition, brings the Cave of Ordeals, which expands on Wolf Links capablities - or, rather, gives you the chance to use them. The Tears of Light are reduced in number (thank Hylia), the Poe Lantern improves the Poe Hunt a fair bit, and other amiibo functionality (despite being physical, limited run DLC) is inconsequential. Except for Ganondorf, who (when doubled with the VERY NECESSARY Hero Mode) brings a real challenge. While Twilight Princess still has flaws, it has improved in some big ways. Ive rated it as 100% since Im rounding up from a 95%.  ORIGINAL REVIEW A solid entry to the 3D Zelda series, but not without its caveats.

3468;;Toby Fox delivers another heartwarming, funny, musically gifted game that shows his talent. Deltarune improves over Undertale in many ways, such as the improved battle system that introduces more RPG mechanics without losing the bullet hell flavor. The game lacks the same amount of choice as Undertale, and while this is somewhat excusable since it ties into the games message, it serves as a reminder of what it might have been. Id rather not stray too negatively, though, as it took me quite some time to even think of a major flaw! Deltarune will certainly make a name for itself, despite its origins in Undertale.;111563;;Lacks choice element;;Great story, amazing music, improved battle system;c;47537;280200
3469;;After playing through Shantae on GBC, I decided to push on to the sequel. Unfortunately the game doesnt match up to the original. First of all, casually playing through it, I clocked in just under 4 hours to beat the games which felt pretty short in comparison to its predecessor, and in terms of design, it felt the same. Less use of the transformations (and less of them in general), and I wasnt particularly interested in collecting the magic jam, with only 3 additional hearts to be found. For the most part, dungeons were less interesting to boot. After all this it didnt help when the final boss battle glitched at the ending, leading to the boss not dying and transitioning to the final ending cutscene with the boss music and sfx still playing, leading me to question whether I had got a bad ending.  The game is a decent platformer but I highly recommend playing the original to get a feel for what the franchise can be.;8430;;;;;c;8607;280792

3471;TL DR: Is this a decent sci-fi space opera with light RPG elements? Yes, it has good pew-pew. Is this a good Mass Effect game? No, it is not.;At release it was loaded with laughable bugs and plagued with bad paid content practice, most of it being the result of a long and troubled development. A few months before getting into it i had read Blood Sweat and Pixel, which dedicated an entire chapter of the book to Andromeda and its development woes (great read, highly recommended) so i had some previous insight of issues..  Having played the entire trilogy with female Shepard i of course straight away picked Sarah Ryder and.. shes no Femshep. Yes the bugs were fixed, but the uncanny valley of stupid facial expressions makes it incredibly difficult to follow along a serious story and develop any kind of feelings towards the main protagonist. By the end of ME3 it was a culmination of memories and emotions, i had lived something with Shepard. With Ryder I rolled my eyes every time she showed up in a cut scene (come to think of it i should have enabled the Helmet on option for cutscenes..).  In a similar fashion, the crew was my no1 appeal for the original trilogy. I my opinion the crew members and their side mission is why Mass Effect (2 in particular) is so great. I.. eerrr.. i dunno who my crew is in Andromeda. Even the Tempest feels like a cheap knockoff the Normandy. All of this mainly due to the fact that the main story doesnt make a ton of sence, i still dont really know why they have left the milky way. Its a new galaxy but nothing feels different, the same relationships, hatreds, and connections still apply exactly the same way as the original trilogy. Being so far away (and in the future) it doesnt make a ton of sense to still have the whole Salarian vs Krogan argument just be the main plot. Not to mention that everyone seems totally cool being the invaders in a brand new galaxy.. Theres a new species, the Angara, who unfortunately feel a bit token ethnic all the way down to the accent.. However were there be sequels (lol) id be interested i discovering more about them, and i quite liked Jaal. The one positive about the crew i definitely have, is the Nomad :D In Mass Effect 1 it was so tedious, but they finally made terrestrial transportation quite fun in Andromeda, nice!  Then theres the gameplay, i wont brush over the much Multiplayer since didnt try much of it, however worth pointing how dishonest and sneaky theyve hid multiplayer missions. Going through basic inventory management in the Tempest i once saw myself leaving my single player game to be dropped into a multiplayer mode (not via the main menu but during the story campaign!). I did not want nor ask for this.. cmon EA, this is Mass Effect: i do not give a shit about multiplayer, sure have it on the side but dont force me into it. Dick move yo. The combat is quite fine, its snappy and follows in the path of ME3 cover shooter mechanics. The jet pack is very fun ill admit. But then theres the RPG elements. Im sad to say after a while i just ended up auto leveling my characters... and just the fact that an RPG gives you the option to auto level up should tell you theres something wrong in the first place. This whole being a jack of all trades thing is fine of paper but in the end i just ended up being nothing at all and not caring about where i allocated my skill points. Then... theres this crafting system thing. You collect random materials, then you craft blueprints then you build gear. urgh, This was just so complicated and messy i gave up on it very early, maybe its due to to the UI being confusing, or maybe its the actual concept i dunno.. but it was not fun. Its all very tedious and meaningless.  I wanted to like this, and i did in parts. Taking time to converse with my crew in the Normandy, eer.. sorry, Tempest, felt very reminiscent of my hours with Commander Shepard. Its a tough legacy to follow, and maybe it is unfair to compare a fresh new start with its previous legacy, and i would be ok if it were a good fresh new start. Unfortunately, even taking the mass effect away from Andromeda i didnt think it was a great experience.;7349;Mass Effect: Andromeda is rough, rather infamously. I went into this knowing fully well the issue that plagued its release, but almost 3 years later one would hope such issues would be fixed so that the actual game would shine.

3476;;I quit after the 2nd level because of the uninteresting story and the mind-boggling puzzles that not only contribute nothing to the adventure, as you never know what is the motive of solving them. In addition, the puzzles themselves arent hard. The hardest part is understanding what you need to do in the first place. For example, there was a puzzle where you need to remove crosses. Fair enough, but nothing is interactive. So I thought, maybe I am missing something. After several minutes I gave up and used the hint feature. It said something along the lines of There is something that blocks the board - No sh!t Sherlock! I can see the crosses are blocking it. So I kept on looking for ways to interact with anything. At last! I fond a slot in the table. I thought that maybe I can insert a card that I had. Nope! It didnt let me use it. -Sigh-... After a while, I was able to use the hint again. This time it said: Maybe the slot in the table can help. What the... Is this game mocking me? Is that what this game came too. (Bare in mind, this is the third puzzle of the first level). I decided to wait for the final hint. This time it said: Insert the punch card into the slot. -Flip a table angrily- I jump online and look for a walkthrough instead. What I discovered is that I needed to use the card on a candle... A freaking CANDLE!!!! Why?! Why would I think about using a card on a candle? Turns out, it revealed a pattern and only then it let me insert it into the table! Only thanks to my wife I kept on going until she lost it as well.

Sure, you might say that Polygons are a bit deceiving in this case due to the difference between the real used Polygons and the Look and Feel of them on the models. On the other side, you might get surprised how much a Game can manage if you just accept the given approach - especially in this minimalistic approach.  This Game can be really good, action-packed and funny, but you need to have at least some folks to play with. The player base is also somewhat Minimum-Sized so waiting for a random Game is sometimes the big thing. Thats sad, obviously.

3480;;To call this game underwhelming would be a disservice to it, but also to call this game thrilling and innovative would be a lie.  The best thing it had going for it was the writing, which was pretty fantastic even by todays standards.  Very comical, and even fourth wall breaking, which was refreshing but overall the lack of depth in the main cast left something to be desired.  I think a lot of my problem comes from how INSANELY straightforward and limited this game was from an exploration standpoint, granted it was from the early 90s but I know there were other JRPGs out at this time that had more to actually DO in them.  By the end, felt it was too tedious and narrow in scope to be grandly lauded, but it did have pretty great music and anime cutscenes.

3481;While still mostly fun, its not nearly as entertaining a balance of platforming, puzzling and combat as Trine 1. Its more frustrating and contrived, with levels that are too long.;Trine 2 is more by every metric, but overall is somehow worse. The levels are longer, the puzzles more detailed, the platforming more precise and the combat more intense. But the controls and the game mechanics werent designed for that. It makes levels a long slog and puzzles a frustrating experience.  In Trine 1 there were multiple ways to beat each puzzle. Most could be solved by any of the three heroes, or at least two different ones. This made the game rather easy, but fun. Very often in Trine 2 only one hero can seem to solve the puzzle, forcing you to think a certain contrived way. It feels less natural. And the increased difficulty works poorly with the floaty physics.;38932;After loving the quirky balance of puzzles, platforming and combat of Trine 1, I dove in the Trine 2 when it came out for the Switch.;Designed to be more intense, which makes the game less fun and more frustrating.;130;Same fun mechanics as Trine 1.;More Intense and Less Fun;42634;283503

I would recommend any veterans do push the difficulty at least one notch from the previous games (in linear order) as most of the game was spam rather than placement. Overall, a nice entry into the series and I am still looking forward to continuing the series (even with what many consider the biggest hurdle coming next).;15457;;;;;c;8607;284287

3491;;All in all, a decent game, although puzzles could have been a bit easier. Fortunately, there is a hint system from several stages that helps in solving puzzles without much frustration. Of course, the one who wants to go through the game without help can turn off hints, but to pass the game without help is not at all easy. It takes a lot of search for hidden buttons and levers, as well as where to start, where to go.    On the other hand, mysticism and atmosphere of Leonardos time was greatly transmitted.

3495;Overall this game is an absolute must for everyone who wants to fully understand the Kingdom Hearts franchise, but I am sure that every single true Kingdom Hearts fan already knows that and I am just extremely late to the party. For everyone else I cant really recommend this game, because I simply dont think it is a good game from a rational standpoint. Instead I would suggest to play the original Kingdom Hearts from 2002 and if is that to your liking and you really want to get deeper into the franchise, then Birth by Sleep is the game for you eventually...after playing Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days beforehand...of course.;- Writing/Story-   Characteristically for a Kingdom Hearts game the characters are likeable while tending to be a little stereotypical and shallow, but oddly enough quite memorable. The english voice acting ranges from actually quite decent all the way to very underwhelming, but I can imagine that acting some of these really clunky, cheesy and subpar dialogue lines can be quite a challenge if you are not already an accomplished and experienced voice actor like Mark Hamill and Leonard Nimoy, who are doing a great job voicing Eraqus and Xehanort. Storywise this is probably one of the if not the most important game one has to play to understand the entire plot of the long lasting Kingdom Hearts series. It serves as a gigantic origin story to pretty much everything relevant in the franchise, explaining multiple plot points in other Kingdom Hearts games and is experienced through the eyes of three protagonists with different routes to choose from. For a full grasp of the story you are required to play through all three routes with the final boss for each route revealing new aspects of the overall plot, heavily differing from character to character. While Ventus‘ and Terra‘s route are quite interesting from a plot point of view, Aqua‘s route is bland and basically consists of Aqua chasing after her friends, trying to make them see reason and come back to their homeworld. The final boss of Aqua‘s route makes up for it, but playing through her standard route is unappealing at best. The biggest highlight is probably the reveal of Xehanort as the main villain of the entire saga, showing ties to all the other Kingdom Hearts and how they are intertwined in Xehanort‘s grand scheme and goal. Apart from that the story holds its own pretty well and is one of the more interesting plots of the franchise, especially when seen in a bigger context and what it does for the entire story of the series.  - Visuals -  For a Playstation Portable title the game looks quite nice but of course never reaches the visual level of one of the home console entries. There are many complaints which could be made about how bland, linear and uninspired the worlds themselves are, but I think that is majorly due to the limitations of the platform the game released on. Back then the Playstation Portable already had massive trouble running the game smoothly, so I understand why they had to keep it simple in size one way or the other.  - Gameplay -  Like in Chain of Memories, the combat system and progression system got revamped by quite a huge margin, but in contrast to Chain of Memories, I think Birth by Sleep managed to change the combat system into something very enjoyable. While the whole command system rubbed me the wrong way at the start, it really grew on me. Also the introduction of charging finishers and shotlocks were huge pluses in my book, adding something very unique to the combat system, while sadly replacing magic bars and equippable abilities. I personally really disliked the very slow nature of fights in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep though, they feel unusually sluggish for a Kingdom Hearts game and especially Terra feels like playing the game in slow motion. I understand why they wanted to make all the three protagonists feel different in terms of gameplay with Ventus relying on speed and dodging, Aqua leaning towards a more magic based combat style and Terra being the slow heavy hitter, but Terra really feels just awful and clunky to play. Speaking of clunky, the platforming sections of the game are probably the most clunky platforming the series has ever seen. People used to complain about Kingdom Hearts platforming since the first game, but Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep really takes the cake here, the controls feel stiff and sometimes even a bit stubborn when it comes to jumping and climbing and I don‘t believe that anyone would miss these sections if they were gone. Another aspect plaguing all entries of the series are the forced minigames you have to play. They have always been my personal biggest weak point in all Kingdom Hearts games and I hate most of them with a passion, because they disturb the flow of the game and have you play through badly designed distractions to drag out the game more for whatever reason. Maybe I am a bit harsh here, but I never understood how you can remotely enjoy the majority of minigames being thrown at you. Another questionable design choice are the difficulty spikes towards the end. Enemies suddenly hit way harder and act like damage sponges with you either having to hammer the attack button for minutes to get one pile of mobs down or you go back and grind in worlds you already finished. Both sounds like terrible game design and I don‘t see how this bypassed the testing at Square Enix. Making the bosses towards the end tougher is understandable, but blasting damage into damage sponges is plain boring and just wastes your time, strongly slowing down your progress. But that is maybe due to the game before you enter the late game being such a cake walk with you almost never being in danger of dying. So it might be the contrast of these two which is feels like a bummer. Speaking of difficulty spikes, some final bosses in this game are easily some of the hardest bosses of the entire series. The most infamous probably being the final boss of Terra‘s route with many people advising to just cheese him down with healing spells and countering his attack with block. I personally didn‘t mind the really rough challenge of the final bosses in this game and actually appreciated it, but I can see how some people play through the entire game and just can‘t get past the final boss, being frustrated so close to the goal. As the last big negative I want to bring up the keyblades you get as a reward for finishing the worlds. Outside of your standard and final keyblade, all the keyblades are dull, uninspired and add barely anything to your playstyle outside of boosting some of your attack and magic stats. As someone who always really looked forward of trying out new keyblades and how they have to be used effectively, it was one of the hugest letdowns in this game.  - World Design -  The worlds you visit are even staler and more boring than the ones in Kingdom Hearts 2, but that was to be expected from a Playstation Portable game. Also the problem of having three protagonists running through the same worlds obviously is that doing so will get repetitive really soon and it definetely hurts the experience even more due to the worlds themselves being so linear, boring and uninspired. While the events in said worlds are different from each other, depending on the chosen route, it doesn‘t help much. Especially the Lilo &amp  Stitch world is an all time low designwise in the entire franchise. It is literally a bunch of corridors with rooms and then a boss fight in one of those rooms. Sure it is a spaceship, but even spaceships can be designed in a more appealing way.;1224;If Disney or Square had hired George Lucas to write a Star Wars movie in the Kingdom Hearts franchise, I am pretty sure that Birth by Sleep would have been the outcome.

All the levels are there, all the key locations are where theyre supposed to be, but at the very least, the levels have been redesigned, with sections added, alternate routes, etc. Its all very true to the original game, just taking advantage of the ability to expand in a newer engine.

Eller valmöjligheterna för att vara lite tydligare och, marginellt, mindre ordvitsig. Fångade i valfiskens buk finns det några olika alternativ att ta sig ut. Och beroende på vilket du väljer kommer ytterligare några händelser som i sin tur har några val. Det låter som de flesta andra spel som försöker ge dig känslan av valfrihet. Men det här är ett kort spel, från start till mål på cirka 20 minuter. Å andra sidan uppmuntras du att spela igen och testa nya val i valen. För när du avslutar ett äventyr arkiveras det i en bokhylla där du tydligt ser vilken väg du tog. Totalt har du ett dussin sätt att ta dig igenom spelet. Det som de tre fiskarna råkar ut för är kraftigt inspirerat av sagor och miljön för tankarna till Norden. Bland annat stöter de på liemannen, sirener, kraken och ett stort stentroll. Allt kryddat med varm humor.  Grafiken, som drar åt det minimalistiska, är rundad och kantig på samma gång, med en behaglig färgskala.

3505;;Perhaps I had bigged this game up too much after playing oath of felghana. The biggest fallback of this game is grinding. The pacing of OoF is superb whereas this is closer to the original ys games (I.II). There were many points in the game where I would meet an enemy which I could not damage at all. This was actually because I didnt have enough damage, meaning some bosses I had to sit around and grind, not because I felt I wasnt strong enough but because the game told me to. This is ok in games with limitations, or in Ys case, a hyper speed combat system which could exploit grinding. But in this game it is not. However, the game starts to pick up about the half way point and this issues isnt a problem. On top of this, Ys has some great music and another brilliant world to explore. I wouldnt recommend this as the first game in the franchise but it is a decent addition to the Ys series.;15454;;;;;c;8607;285889
3506;Played through it in about 9 hours, which is more than i anticipated to be honest, i thoroughly enjoyed it as a quick bite of over the top gaming.   I stand by the same arguments ive made of all the other Uncharted: great game,  terrible Movie :D;Lost Legacy doesnt add much to Uncharted 4, although i believe the lock picking mini game is new (could be wrong here..), aside from that its standard Uncharted business: -Jaw dropping visual. Check. -Annoying wise cracking protagonists. Check. -Tons of fun. Check. -Completely over the top action coupled with ridiculous story. Double check.  Half of Lost Legacy pretty much plays out like the Madagascar level of 4, with semi open exploration (the Jeep even makes a comeback), and the other half is the standard linear progression punctuated with platforming and gunfights.Clearly does not set to re-invente the wheel, and thats ok since it works very well.   My biggest gripe comes from Chloe Fraser. Shes unfortunately nearly identical as Nathan Drake, all the way down to the annoying wise cracking infuriating stubbornness. I dont recall her character much from the original trilogy (replaying them is on my to do list), maybe this is how she was.. I would have liked more character development from her, instead she feels like a copy pasted template :(;26193;A quickie dive back into Uncharted, perfect bang for your buck  );story is absolutely ridiculous!

3509;;Plot---- The Story is well thought out, a guy who turns into a girl. For a few days experiences the life of a girl attracting guys and even fooling around with some all while trying to return back to being a male. The pacing is great, nothing feels too long or too short. The main characters are all likable and there is quite a bit of character progression. The story itself isnt very original feels as though a lot of people would have thought of a similar type of plot making. Nothing was built upon the thought of What if a guy became a girl. It is very Linear as its a visual novel although the story does change depending on your choices in the game. The length is quite short which i found is great for games like these, it does not get boring and after completing the game it leaves you wanting more, enough to play the sequel.  Presentation----- The artwork is well done albeit old looking which is understandable considering the game was released in 2001. It does hold up well though. The music is nice fits somewhat well with what is going on  on screen. The sound effects on the other hand arent that great and gets quite boring over time good thing you can disable it.  Mechanics------ The game is very easy to use no controls just reading and clicking a button when youre done or just using your mouse to pick a choice. I believe it is quite repayable as its quite short and you can easily skip through everything you already saw/read.

3510;;Plot----  The plot is very similar to the first one. The Main Character becomes a female again, then must find a way to return back to normal. While completing tasks and interacting with various characters most of them being new. The pacing is well done, although some of the scenes feel like they are being dragged on for longer than they should or just that there are too many adult scenes. The characters are well thought of, some of them are very likable although a few newer characters will just make you wish they werent in the game to begin with. The story is so similar that there is barely anything original going on, some puzzles are original though even if they are annoying. The Story again is very linear and very easy to follow and understand. Length is much longer than the first game. In fact its too long, by the middle of the game you will find yourself asking when will it be over.  Presentation-----  Visuals are great same artist who created the artwork from the first game. Nicely done. Music is also well done even though i had a feeling that it was somewhat similar to the first games soundtrack. The Sound FX sucks, its exactly the same as the previous one and gets super annoying after a while.  Mechanics------  Being a Visual Novel the ease of use is great, click the button to progress and use the mouse to pick your choices. Due to the length of the game and the fact that the story is very similar to the first game lowers the replayability. There are still many different endings to choose from but the game long and somewhat boring at times.

3511;;Plot----  The Story is well made and planned nicely, An ancient Kingdom is attacked by monsters that had been driven underground and sealed for centuries only for the seal to be broken and for them to escape. You as a princess must embark on a quest to save your kingdom. Unfortunately the pacing is a bit slow and takes time to grind in order to level up or to complete a certain quest or get a certain item. The characters are all good, they are of course mostly in revealing clothes and showing off their skin, yet they still show their history which gives depth to the characters and makes you see how they are. Id say the story is very original have not heard of a story like that ever and its very interesting to play making you wonder what will happen next. The game is quite linear but it is easy to get sidetracked by sidequests or by trying to grind a stat up high enough. Length is great. Its neither too long nor too short. Perfect to play and have fun with and experience the story.  Presentation-----  The artwork is well done although the environment is in its default RPG maker fashion despite all that though the game still manages to show a good level of polish and cleanliness. The music is on point. I had to extract the soundtrack just so i could listen to it separately. Sound FX are great, but use the default sounds that come with RPG maker games. They are not annoying and blends well with the music and whats happening on screen.  Mechanics------  The game was made from an RPG maker game design. Thus it has simplified mechanics using wasd on the keyboard and space/enter key to continue or to choose a certain choice. The game has an average replayability for me at least, upon finishing the game I had no urge to either restart the game or want a sequel. But one can certainly replay it has there are two modes of playing, Kogal mode or True Princess mode, in either mode you can either choose to fight or to allow the enemies to abuse your character. Which will yield different endings.

3512;;Plot----  Story is quite frankly crap. A guy decides to get his revenge in a rapey fashion on a family because one of the girls called the police on him when he was trying to push himself onto another girl. Pacing is good though it doesnt stay on one scene too long once a scene is over it goes to the next. The characters are shallow and have no substance to them. The game isnt very original its pretty much a rapey simulator... Its very linear has no side stories going on and no choices to make for the character. Length is quite short if you skip through the badly translated dialogue and know how to do the scenes. Otherwise it gets a bit long and somewhat tedious to do the same thing over and over again.  Presentation-----  The character models for the girls are kinda appealing albeit a bit uncanny for me. The environment shown isnt filled with detail but there is some detail nonetheless. Visuals for the adult scenes are honestly laughable at times having a few key parts missing from the scene. The music is mediocre at best its good to have if lowered and heard as a real background sound. Sound FX are alright too but the moaning and voices do get annoying as well as some other sounds. They did a good job though with capturing the sounds on a subway but thats about all i can give as a complement for this game.    Mechanics------  Ease of Use is a bit low, its quite hard at first to understand what the controls are and what is going on really. But once you get used to it then it gets easier. Replayability is non-existant for this game. Once you finish its done. One does not have a need to restart and try to find some sort of sequel.

3513;;Plot----  Story is well planned out and thought about. A guy who transfers to a school for the disabled. There he befriends various disabled girls ranging from missing arms, to blindness, deaf, bipolarity and scarred/anxious. Depending on the choices the player makes the character will then fall in love with one of the girls.  Characters all have a surprising amounts of depth and the game really tries to make you see and understand the struggles the girls go through. The characters themselves are enough to make you want to replay and meet them all over again. The game is very original in that it takes a guy who is somewhat normal who falls in love with a certain disabled girl, he sees and supports her through her endeavors. The game takes itself quite seriously although there are some funny moments. Its actually hard to not tak e it seriously. For many gamers, they come for the adult scenes but they stay for the story and feels. Length is great, in fact the story is so good you will be wishing it didnt end or had a sequel to continue the story and seeing how each girl will live in the future with the main character.  Presentation-----  The visuals are great done in a typical anime fashion but on top of that there are the occasional animations making it feel like a real anime show of some sort. Beautifully done. The music is top notch, great to listen to and fits extremely well with the events happening on screen. Sound FX are good not annoying at all which is great. Pacing is good although sometimes it feels stretched out  Mechanics------  Visual Novel so its extremely easy to use. Combined with having an excellent story have having each choice play out somewhat differently and even get various different endings as well as the enjoyable and amazing characters makes this games replayability really high.

3514;;Ultimately, time has not really been kind fo this once amazing and innovative step forward in gaming.  Nostalgia for it seems to underplay how rudamentary the controls and setting are, along with the fact that the characters are probably the most chilched and barebones you could possibly ask for, though voice acted fairly well for the time.  It had a lot going for it in terms of making a bold leap forward for open world games, but in retrospect so much of it was limited and has been done SOOOO much better in later iterations that this game ends up being a relic of a time long past.  Also, the radio stations get super annoying and repetative after a short amount of time.  Fun, but super dated at this point.

3515;;Not the most inspired choice Im aware, but Skyrim is undeniably one of the strongest and most accessible RPGs ever assembled. The worlds massive - both in scope and variety of things to do - while exploration is rewarding, the mechanics are solid yet deep and quests are superbly designed. It simply feels epic, from the smaller moments as you journey through its astoundingly ambitious open-world or in bigger ones, where the music swells and you charge into colossal battles.

3516;;Its garish. loud, a bit juvenile, and the story is paper-thin. But the graphics and the gunplay are dead-on perfection. What else do you expect from the guys at id? Their graphics tech has always been some of the best. The open world portion was done by Avalache, probably best known as the creators of the Just Cause series - another open-world romp that looks great, plays great, but isnt exactly an intellectual challenge. But you know what? Thats okay sometimes. Not everything needs to be meaningful or somber. Sometimes you just want to shoot the s*** out of everyone and everything. RAGE 2 satisfies that craving.;101211;;Weak plot  mainly a justification for your progression and a reason for the gunfights. Can be a bit of a grind.;;Stellar graphics, rock-solid gameplay.

3517;;I mostly like it. I like exploration and puzzle games, and this is a good example. The main puzzle mechanic is piecing together fragments of an ancient language. As for the plot, you begin by searching the galaxy for a missing scientist. But theres much more under the surface - questions of philosophy and faith, the mysteries of history, and the questionable intent of the ruling government.   The open world exploration is somewhat wonky and strange. Your character doesnt walk through the game, but rather ghosts from one point to another, in small jumps, It makes navigating around more difficult than it should be, but the game just isnt set up like a traditional 3D engine would be. Its hard to explain, but the difficulty of getting to where you want to go definitely breaks the immersion.  Otherwise, its a fine game - a uniquely thoughtful and deep experience.;27509;;Movement feels wrong and imprecise.

3519;Overall - as always - there are two ways to look at a gamey game (That is mainly about gameplay, mixed with story). As game with gameplay its good, the technical issues aside. As experience that could be so much more than just killing zombies, its an okay attempt.;First of all: WIth Hell or High Water this games got one of the most beautiful songs ever. Just by hearing it for the first time in a trailer for the game I already got tears in my eyes. Unfortunately the game in general doesnt do too much with emotional stuff like that and the song is a bit wasted in the game. Still, good score too overall. Rockstar games aside, this also is the best open world to-date. Having said that, its still a typical open world and therefore at least 50% useless filler.  I played for around 13 hours which is way more than I usually devote to a game (Perfect length is anything between 2-8 hours). After a game breaking bug and a bit of boredom I finished watching the story on Youtube, so I stopped 2 or 3 hours before the end. Of those around 16 hours at least 10 hours are typical open world filler and wouldnt exist in a well paced experience that hooks you from start to finish. Technically this game is really a mess, especially for a big budget project like that. The dialogue direction in particular is pretty much awful. Characters suddenly scream or have very strange intonations that dont match the scenes whatsoever. Whenever youre close to getting lost in the story, setting and atmosphere, shortly afterwards a character speaks completely out of place and youre instantly reminded nothing matters. The whole dialogue is mixed poorly too, you often cant hear what is being said.  Even with those technical issues I hang on for so long, partly because very well painted characters that look so different to your usual mainstream blockbuster and a great setting in general. And even though the gameplay (aka shooting) gets boring fast, its still pretty fun and you would just love to be in that world (if before mentioned issues wouldnt be there).;19561;General info about me: Im not a so called gamer. I love interactive experiences that are more than just gameplay exercises, more than just shooting at people and repeating the same loop from start to finish.

3520;;Shovel Knight is an alright action platformer. My main point of critique is that the game is a massive grind, because the levels are all about memorizing. Each level is centered around its boss, resulting in each level being very different and showing lots of interesting mechanics. However the levels are designed in such away that you have to move in a very specific pattern. Which takes all of the fun out of the levels. You can finish each stage in 10 minutes, but on your first time it will take around an hour. In total it takes about 10 hours to finish the main game, which is a good length (but short for the price).;7444;;- Grindy - Annoying level design;6;- Nice retro graphics - Great music - Good variety of level mechanics;Good and bad platformer;35434;287157

They made the MegaDrive (Genesis) version and this Gameboy clone for the popular Movie Universal Soldier with Van Damme (Producer: Roland Emmerich (Independence Day))  The game itself is not completely copied, at the first you have a Jungle setting and other soldiers coming your way. The weapons and handling (morph into a sphere, multidirectional laser) are the same. Later the enemies are mostly the same. Endbosses not.  The famous Turrican Soundtrack is in the level music and it´s technically interesting that it was possible to get these huge levels and sprites into the little gameboy hardware.;38416;;huge healthbar at the bottom;;Passcodes!

3522;The characters are lovely and Charming. The art is beautiful and looks great (even on the Switch where I played the demo first before I bought it on the PC.)  It’s an intriguing and original story that you can sit back and enjoy and maybe even shed a tear but whatever happens do not let Anne be forgotton in your playlist this year.;Forgotton Anne is a wonderfully drawn world in which you experience a range of character and choices. You’re not quite sure in the beginning who’s right or who’s wrong but the concept of the world is a brilliant concept. An entire world where everything that has been forgotten by its owners is brought there and they must live out their existence as forgottlings without their owners: a forgotten sock, shoe, watches all forgotten by their owners. Everyone wants to return home…  Well, not everyone one.  A resistance is forming and there have terrorist attacks take place which stops everyone from returning home. Anne, a human and as the enforcer, has to find out who is doing this and why.   By doing so you are faced with puzzles to get to the next stage (nothing you can’t solve). And the dialogue is handled via a dialogue tree. So get your BioWare on.  You slowly get somewhat upgraded overtime with your gear. So you will be reaching higher obstacles but there is no combat in this game. This is a puzzle and story driven game. Period. If you love story, art and music and can deal with just a little bit of puzzles this is the game for you. If you just want big fire and death then skip it.;24426;This is Paul from the Scott and Paul show and Forgotton Anne was my personal choice for 2019’s favorite game of the year.

The issue is that you want a lot more from it than what i has to offer. After a couple of level i realised i had seen pretty much all of it, there arent nearly as many environment interaction as i wanted, and the strategy is very simple (referring to avoiding the cops).  If youre going into this wanting a Hitman type of game, probably rethink since its very light on the crowd and environment interactions.

3536;;While I was a pretty big Pokemon fan back in the day, I was surprised to see myself enjoying a game like this as a kid. I would have probably preferred something like Pokemon Stadium or another core RPG game instead, but I ended up getting a kick out of this. Even today as an adult I think its a solid little romp. Its a nice, easy-going little safari game where you get to take pictures of various Pokemon and interact with them in different ways yielding different results or uncovering new secrets. Its not a very long game, though, so I really only recommend this to hardcore Pokemon fans or those that are just looking for something to breeze though and enjoy.;2324;;-Remarkably short -It could use some more Pokemon variety;;-Simple, relaxing fun -All the Pokemon look great -Fun and interesting to see Pokemon in their natural environment and to interact with them -Surprisingly addicting to go back and replay levels to get better shots and discover new secrets;c;48956;288340

Do yourself a favor and buy this game.  ...okay, wait for The Royal edition of this game to come out, THEN buy it. If you are an RPG fan you owe yourself at least one playthrough.;This is not only one of the best RPGs of its generations, this has easily become one of my all time favorite games. Everything from the style, to the combat, the music, the characters, the story. Everything here just clicks with me. This is easily the most refined and fleshed out Persona game to date. It keeps much of the same mechanics as past games in the series while tightening up core gameplay and offering uniquely crafted dungeons compared to Personas 3 and 4. It positively oozes style and personality, and the soundtrack hasnt left my brain since my first playthrough. The story and themes of the game, while far from subtle, are incredibly compelling. Each of the characters and little side stories are unique and interesting in their own way. Youre not gonna be able to see everything the game has to offer in a single sitting, making it great for replayability.;9927;While not having much experience with the Persona series, I was still rather interested in checking out Persona 5 if only for its presentation alone.

The sneaking and hiding part of the game is well made, as well as the fighting and shooting mechanics. The RPG-like skill/ability tree was fun to max out and to test them out during the game. Different appoaches, different ways to kill/stun/disable enemies, everything felt good. Different choices during conversations made the game versatile and fun. All in all, a good solid game, which I fully recommend.;2539;;Small amount of bugs, sometimes the game felt unfair (enemy spots you);;Replayable, good mechanics, good sound, graphics were good at the time, still enjoyable nowadays;c;48928;288377
3542;;An outstanding game period.  The presentation is stellar, the level design and game mechanics are fun and fast paced, and the atmostphere is forboding and creepy.  If I had some criticism of this game it would be the backtracking that was NECESSARY near the end of the game to find all the artifacts (Maguffins that didnt really add any powers or abilities, but were necessary to get to the end of the game)- I felt these should have been accessible more when you were in each stage than forcing you to go back and get them through VERY ambiguous text for their locations.  Added unnecessary time to the game that bogged it down at the end.  Other than that, probably one of the coolest Metroid experiences ever- so much fun!

3544;;Call of Duty: World at War is one of the old CoD games. So the graphics arent indistinguishable from real life, like Red Dead Redemption 2. This is mainly noticable in the environment, while the character models (except faces) are quite decent. This CoD really shows the brutality of war  with guerilla warfare (Japan), burning people alive with flame throwers and murdering surrendering soldiers. The great thing is that it doesnt try to tell you what is right/wrong, letting you decide for yourself. There are also a good amount of checkpoints, handy for when you die by grenades (I only got killed by grenades).  The bad parts of this game are the grenade spam by enemies, one garbage level in which you fight in a t-34, multiple crashes and the last level was bugged (so I couldnt finish the game). More minor problems are that the flame thrower is too over powered and the enemies can sometimes be stupid. The gameplay is also a bit repetitive, though you do switch between the East-European and Japanese theater every couple of levels (enemies fight quite differently in other theater).;625;;- Grenade spam - Multiple crashes - Last level was bugged (couldnt finish the game) - Terrible level in which you control a t-34;6;- Brutal depiction of war (war is brutal after all) - Enemies have different tactics in the other theater - Interesting variety of mission types - Large amount of weapons - Plenty of checkpoints;They deserve no mercy;35434;289521
3545;All in all, I recommend this game. Even if you have not played any FF games before, this is a fun one! I have a feeling from reviews I have read that there are better FF games out there that I have yet to play, but for the early series (I-V) this is my favorite. This game is definitely worth buying.;This FF IV remake was a great introduction to the series. I have not played the original, but I think this was a good place to start. It has a gripping story, albeit trying to be too serious and dark at times. This is definitely a game that tries too hard! That being said, the content is amazing when you get past that fact. Wonderful characters and I love the atypical protagonist who starts out to be somewhat of a villain (or at least he views himself that way). The story jumps right in and there are not many slow moments in the game. Some elements can be deus ex machina, but I cannot give more details without spoilers. There are also some repetitive plot devices. Battle system was new to me, but I highly enjoyed it! There is a huge difficulty spike for the last boss and dungeon, which I personally did not like, but that is subjective.;399;This was my introduction to the wonderful FF series, so I will preemptively say that nostalgia may influence my opinions!

3549;;It’s a mission/quest based, cyberpunk-themed dungeon crawler. The basics should be familiar to anyone who’s played Grimrock or Vaporum. The major difference is that the dungeons are individual and procedurally generated, as opposed to being parts of an open world.   The art style is very Blade Runner, and very well done. The environments look great. The soundtrack is a pulsating late-80s style industrial/techno that fits the theme perfectly.   There’s a kind of base-building and team-management aspect as well, somewhat like the XCom games.   It’s got a few rough spots still, but there’s lots of potential.;116593;;A little rough around the edges  more tutorials are promised Limited, procedural dungeons not as compelling as a larger world would be.;6;Great soundtrack Good art design Always need good cyberpunk games;Early Access, but lots of potential;44467;289815
3550;;While the open world aspects of this game are stellar, along with the majority of the presentation, the only thing I was kind of surprised by was how brief the game seemed overall.  Honestly, the story is relatively straightforward, with almost no twists of any kind, and ends on a less than epic note.  Felt like Arkham Asylum at least had more of a build-up of some kind.  Either way, the puzzle elements were fantastic, the structure of the levels were inspired, and just about everything else in this game is top notch.  Just dont think it should be as lauded as some people might think it should be.

3551;Fallout 76 is the black sheep of the Fallout franchise. It has some redeeming qualities, but not enough to negate all those issues the game has. But if youre willing to look past those issues, you probably will have a lot of fun.;First I think I need to say that I picked up Fallout 76 very recently, so I wasnt there when the game was at its worst, so I will be talking about the game in its current state and I wont be adressing issues that it had in the past.    Im a huge fan of single player open world RPGs. I love exploring, interacting with interesting characters and hearing their stories. And since FO76 is basically an MMORPG with no human NPCs and no interesting characters to talk to, youd think that I wouldnt enjoy this game at all. But lo and behold, Ive played this game for more than 10 hours (at the time of writing this review) and Im not going to stop playing any time soon. Why? Because even though there are no human NPCs, there are still interesting stories to be heard. And even though this game is an MMORPG, I can still play completely solo and the chance of having to deal with other players in any way is very slim because the map is really huge, which brings me to the next point - exploration. Like I said earlier, I love exploring huge open worlds, which is something that was a big part of every Fallout game, and this one is no expection. In fact, its probably the best one in this regard. The map is huge, there are plenty of interesting locations scattered all around multiple completely different regions. And I love it.    But Fallout 76 also has many issues, and some of them are unfortunately a part of the game design itself. For example, I dont like the fact that you have to unlock/discover weapon and armor mods. Why not leave it the way it was in FO4? You had all the mods available, but you needed to have certain perks to be able to craft them. Another thing that bothers me is the way perks and skills are handled. In previous games when you leveled up, you chose a perk and assigned skill points to your skills and that was it. In Fallout 4, they basically removed skills and instead integrated them in the perks system. I was fine with that. But what Im not fine with is how you can only have a certain amount of perks active and if you need another perk, you have to deactivate another perk, which makes it harder to build your character a certain way.    The last thing I want to talk about are stability issues and big amounts of bugs and glitches. Its pretty common that a group of enemies will just spawn directly in front of you and totally destroy you before youre able to even draw your weapon. Another thing that can happen is you walking around the world exploring, and suddenly you are disconnected from the server for no reason at all. Or, and this is one of my favourites, there can be ghouls who will run towards you almost at the speed of light and even if you clearly shoot them, the game doesnt register it as a hit. Sounds fun, right?;103020;;A lot of bugs and glitches Bad perk system Basically no NPCs Atomic Shop (microtransactions) Bad weapon and armor modding system Mostly boring side quests;;Huge and interesting world Graphics Weapon degradation Survival elements;Black sheep of the Fallout franchise;34134;290101
3552;;The one bit of writing advice everyone should adhere to is write what you know. In this case, the fact that the creators stuck to this piece of advice is the games great tragedy, and just how closely they followed it is what makes the tragedy work so well. Everything is genuine. Not even the most allegorical piece of this game can be considered pretentious, because its abundantly clear that the creators actually went through the horrible experience that theyre depicting, with all its ups, downs, hope, fear, joy and despair.  The game itself isnt exactly mind-blowingly designed or crafted and indeed quite flawed, but the experience is more than the sum of its parts. Some wont be able to get into it, but Id chalk that up to ill-fitting expectations or just a case of the game not being able to engage them  no accounting for taste.

3556;;If you are playing in numbered order, this one feels a bit rough. Although there isnt anything exceptional I can point out, Amongst the Ys game there were a lot more instances where I wasnt really into it, the game starts off slow with the limited skills and, likely because I bumped up the difficulty this time around, there were many instances of damage sponges to prolong the combat. By the mid point, I was in the groove, but after act 2 begins, there was too much option. Skills would rarely be learned as I would get a new weapon before I could finish, characters were left in the dust after picking some favorites (like Ys IV, but with much more severe repurcussions) and you are forced to run through the same map. I was surprised with how well this game is reviewed in the context of the series as this only above Ys V in my honest opinion not bad enough to skip but theres no reason to push yourself with this one.

There are different pace levels to choose from according to your taste.  There are also skills upgrades and life add ons during the stages. collect hearts to increase your life power and there is also a three droplets when you collect all of them your skills gets enhanced.

3563;;Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about choices and consequences played in a world in which your action have little consequences. If you kill people, you just pay your bounty and everyone forgets about it. Same goes for robbing people or carriages. The story is great, but drags on for too long. Your horse will also run into literally every rock or tree, which is really annoying. Im sure no real horse will run into a tree even if you try to steer it to it.  Now imagine if the game wasnt so linear and you have your own gang  you pick members from people you run into, they can get killed and betray you, the camp actually has meaning (gang moral).

3564;;Explore space! Solve puzzles! Meet odd characters. Unravel a mystery.   Die.   Do it again.   Die.   And again.  But that’s how it’s supposed to go. On each launch of your spaceship, you’re going to die. Even if you pilot your ship accurately and don’t fall into a crevasse or run out of oxygen, the sun is going to go supernova. And you’re gonna die.   But you remember everything when you come back, although your home planet friends don’t notice.   This loop is the primary hook to Outer Wilds. There’s no saving, except between loops.   The loops, so far, can be quite fun and the game doesn’t drag out setting up the mystery. It can be a bit tedious doing the takeoff routine and heading back the planet or moon you were last on. You have an autopilot,  but it might steer you into an asteroid on the way.   On day one of its release, I’m going to call it a good game. If it turns out to be a great game, I’ll say so.;11737;;Space flight has a semi-realistic feel and complexity that’s not in keeping with the light-hearted nature of the rest of the game.

Its got a wonderful Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy vibe to it (one of the raw materials you can collect is toaster juice).   If you die - and you will - most of your belongings survive, and you get a new, rehydrated human to play as. Most of them will have traits that will make your exploits either harder or easier - you dont get to choose. I had one body who was a security specialist, which showed all turrets on the map. Another one was a smoker, whod cough every few moments and give away your position.  Oh, and dont forget - you have a limited supply of oxygen, so you cant explore every single corner and corridor. Refills on oxygen, health, and ammo - while aboard another vessel - are relatively rare. Youve basically got to complete your raid, grab as many goodies as you can, then get back to your own ship.

While some levels really feel right at home in a Sonic game like Green Hill Zone or Scrap Brain Zone... Most of them dont and thats this games biggest flaw. Some examples would be Bridge Zone which introduces side-scrolling with instant-death pits and moving enemies or Forest Zone where you have to climb the level vertically using very small moving platforms. No need to mention they feel very awkward with Sonic physics and arent fun to play in. And when Zone 3 is over, the pain train is here in the form of bosses! Not only do you usually have no rings for those battles but the bosses are too simple in design and feel super boring but also very punishing since you must know when to attack as you can usually only land one shot before they attack again, usually with an annoying projectile. While the musics fine, its not enough for me to recommend this game. Really not a must-play, but it will make you appreciate the original Genesis game way more afterward, even Labyrinth Zone!;106274;;-...but most of them arent - Small screen on Game Gear - Bosses arent fun to battle against;;- Soundtrack - Final Zone looks cool - Some stages are well-designed...;c;49616;292856

Story keeps you interested, collectibles and side missions are a nice distraction.

For example: I see that the developers wants to make camp upgrading or more animals in the game. AND in an open world game, you cant change outfits just a little bit? Come on...... I bet if i finish the game updates will make it happen XD. Like always.;19561;;Repetitive gameplay The game is not finished like the developers want Just a little customization;;Graphics Story Music;c;23537;280798
3576;;This game is a mess, honestly. While the level themselves looks nice,  they all feel like some sort of weird fever dream. It doesnt make much sense and didnt felt very fun to play.  Every level have their own annoying gimmick like level 2 has an annoying deltaplane that has similar physics than the feather from Super Mario World except slower and harder to control (yet is mandatory to complete the second act) and level 3 has an annoying bubble that will pop if it touches anything which is extremely annoying! as well! The bosses are better than Sonic 1 8-bit but not by much and the final level is a pure nightmare.  You can tell this game was put together in a rush for the release of Sonic 2 without any care or planning before starting development, so you just get a game that throw anything it can at the wall hoping anything sticks. Well, at least Level 4s theme did stick as it got used as Sonic CDs Theme Song, but nothing much else did in my opinion.;112884;;- Levels are a pain - Gimmicks are annoying to control - Tails isnt even playable - Camera is annoying on both releases;;- Some unique backgrounds - Some alright tunes;c;49616;292864
3577;;Now this is how you do a Sonic on 8-bit consoles! The level design isnt too busy or difficult to make it fair for Game Gear players. You can play as either Sonic or Tails where Tails acts as some sort of easy mode! (You cannot get any chaos emeralds with him however) Bonus stages are fun and easy to access (maybe too easy but thats a nice change of pace honestly) and the levels are different enough of each-other and have unique ideas like a spring vehicle without putting the fast-paced design to a halt. Levels are kinda small but its a small price to pay for fun level-design! And they finally figured out how to do bosses right using Sonic 2s template of using Giant Badniks as bosses really works well here and you can finally hit them multiple times, making them a breeze if youve mastered the controls! I personally think its the best 8-bit Sonic game and Id recommend it to anyone! The final level is kinda hard but the difficulty progresses nicely so its not a deal-breaker.;43322;;- Bonus Stages are a bit overpowered - Levels are a bit short;;- Music & Graphics - Fun & engaging level-design - Super-fun bosses;c;49616;292867
3578;;While I applaud this sort-of Mode 7, I cant say its a very fun game. The AI is way too good and take too much space on the road, making it very hard to pass them, the items dont add much to the experience and all the tracks feels the same besides the aesthetics. I cant tell they wanted to counter Super Mario Kart but here, they clearly failed and it makes for a very dated game that feels like a tech-demo.;45798;;- Gameplay is too limited - Tracks all feel the same - The AI is way too advantaged;;- Good 3D effect - Good OST for 10 seconds loops;c;49616;292868
3579;;Sequel to Sonic Chaos, while its slightly inferior to its predecessor, its also a great time and even use some 8-bit Sonic gimmicks for a better effect! Story is more fledged-out in this installment and we even get a new character, Nack the Weasel! Bonus stages are harder to come across in this game as I never come across one in my gameplay. Levels are longer than Sonic Chaos without dragging-out or feeling unfair unlike most of the handheld Sonic games. Id recommend if you enjoyed Sonic Chaos and want more!;19556;;- Bonus levels are maybe too well-hidden - Soundtrack isnt as good as Chaos;;- Great graphics - Nice story progression - Good level design;c;49616;292869
3580;;Incredible how much they improved this game with its sequel! They fixed most complains about it. AI has been nerfed hard yet still being challenging and the road has been made larger so you can pass opponents more easily. Items are now way more useful as youll usually be closer to each-other. Tracks are VERY varied, most having different tunes and backgrounds to each-other as well as something I didnt expect, STAGE HAZARDS! Most of them get re-used once or twice but they do really help making each track feel more distinct and the game that much more engaging! The game can still be pretty unfair and messy at times but its still now a real worthwhile experience. Not as good as Super Mario Kart, but definitely worth checking out if youre interested!;46358;;...Yet still have its cheap moments Some turns feel almost impossible to take properly;;Vastly Improved gameplay Amazing tunes for 10 second loops! Tracks feels very distinct to each-other AI is way more fair now...;c;49616;292870
3581;;Ill play the devils advocate and defend this game. Sure, it might not be your cup of tea and it might be a terrible idea on paper but when you play, you really get what youre promised, good labyrinths as Sonic who can still spindash! While I abandoned at the last stage (because its insanely hard) the rest is fair and fun and most of them feel very good when you finally figure them out and the slow pacing never was a problem for me. Bosses arent that good but they are completed quickly without much pain so it doesnt take away much from the game. Only get into that if youre fine with labyrinths tho.;19731;;- Bosses are messy - The final level is a bit too much;;- Simple yet fun mazes to explore - Spin-dashing around is pretty cool!;c;49616;292871
3582;;Pretty much average and the graphics dont help. Most of the stages are fine (besides Blue Marine Zone which is a pain) and most bosses are actually pretty fun! And you can pick between Sonic & Knuckles which is pretty cool! But its sadly not a very memorable game and it doesnt really have much to offer. You really dont miss anything if you just skip this one but if you really want more Sonic, you could always play that, its passable but thats it.;19538;;- Blue Marine Zone - Graphics;;- Bosses - Two playable characters;c;49616;292872
3583;The game started well offering beautiful asthetics and polished gameplay but ultimately the story is told in a very linear railroaded world that didnt offer any real reason to progress after a certain point. Given the very slow or non existent character dialogue I wasnt invested in my character. I didnt identify as Kratos and I was no longer being challenged so the game just fizzled out. Perhaps a replay on the hardest difficulty mode is in my future to make the game feel like more of an accomplishment. Perhaps when doing that I should ignore all the meaningless collectibles and sidequests that only prove to upgrade my character too much. Perhaps I should just spend my time on playing another game... Hopefully one day Ill understand why Im missing the point with this game and come back to change my 6 to a 10.;I fancy myself a gamer who likes a challenge so diligently picked Give me a challenge and headed out into the world.  Initially there was very little storyline and I guess thats OK, I had a simple mission to achieve so off I went. The game felt great as I got to grips with my weaponry  slashing, throwing, rolling and dodging through an increasing level of enemy difficulty. The game does well to slowly introduce you to different challenges so you learn your skillset in an organic fashion and that meant everything leading up to the first boss was fairly easy to get through. The first boss was an immediate step up in terms of difficulty so readjusting and learning the abilities and timings was a necessity. It was challenging enough, requiring a few attempts to pass and the game felt fresh and exciting. I eagerly anticipated what laid ahead.  By this point nothing much had opened up in terms of storyline and I probably had more questions than answers handed to me. I had been picking up collectibles along the way, all of which felt fairly meaningless but now I knew they existed I wasnt going to let a blade of grass go untouched without checking whether I had missed something. I had also been warned that there were collectibles and upgrades that when missed, would not be able to be recollected until much later in the game, so instead of being a great adventurer I now found myself plodding through the game to ensure nothing was left behind.  The second and final great challenge I experienced, came when entering a pit of enemies. Completely surrounded by foes, coming to life and spawning in waves. This really tested my basic character progression and as the fight sequence was so long I really could only make a few mistakes before Id have to try again. I must have attempted this 30+ occasions before defeating it in a great sigh of relief and accomplishment. It felt great to finally hone my skills until I could take this on with enough perfection to get through unscathed.  My character had equipped some new gear and had some skill upgrades  all fairly standard stuff, but I had decided to stop upgrading further so as not to spend points in the wrong places if a later encounter required a specific strategy, after all most things had been fairly easy so far with a couple of places where this was not the case, however I did upgrade my axe wherever possible.  After continuing through caves, mountains and lakes, killing and meeting trolls, dragons, world serpents and more, all the while exploring every part of every zone and unlocking more of the story I realised I wasnt having much fun. I hadnt encountered anything challenging and had 44 thousand unspent experience points so there was no real reason to upgrade further and learn new skills and ways of fighting. The collectibles didnt offer much feeling of satisfaction upon clearing a zone 100% and just proved to annoy me if it was any otherwise. I had hit a point of stagnation and instead of taking on the next realm with excitement I just sort of stopped playing the game.;19560;Let me start my review with the preface that I have not completed the game, but Ive played through maybe 15 hours so feel that should give me a solid enough understanding of what game-play mechanics it has to offer.  Coming to the game as an outsider of the franchise, but interested in Norse mythology (having recently picked up a copy of Henry Adams Bellows translation of the Poetic Edda) I really wanted to love this game, exploring the world and characters that it would offer me  I bought the GoW special edition PS4 Pro (my first PS4) and couldnt wait to start my adventure.;Enemies and encounters dont scale well with your characters progression past the introduction Meaningless trinkets and collectibles makes the completionist in me lose momentum in the more enjoyable aspects of the game Combat becomes a bit formulaic, dodge, dodge, hit, dodge dodge hit;48;Theme, visuals and sound is exceptional Some epic concepts and ideas;A bitter end;45508;293204
3584;;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is an old first person shooter. Therefor textures are quite low resolution and most assets are made out of just a handfull of polygons (resulting in rough shapes). The main selling point of games like this today is the gameplay. The game is famous for the d-day mission, which was quite challenging in a fun way. The AI is great at times  flanking you, moving from cover to cover and throwing grenades (no grenade spam like old CoDs). However at other moments its bad  not shooting you, taking the same route as the guy I killed seconds ago and never missing a shot (unless smg).  In one of the last levels you go through sniper town, which was just frustrating. It was then followed by a terrible tank section, though it ended good with you sniping enemies trying to blow up a bridge. The main issue I have with the game is the health system. There were quite a few times that I had very little health at a checkpoint, right before a very hard part of mission. Coupled with the quick save system, youre incentivised to constantly save and reload to make sure you have plenty of health at all times  thereby ruining the flow of the game. This could have easily been fixed by increasing the health to a certain minimum at a checkpoint (say min of 50%).  One of my favourite missions was the last mission. Sneaking through Hurtgen forrest in the snow, going undercover, clearing out buildings in a town, stealthing past guard towers and fighting your way through a large underground facility. The music and sound effects;326;;- Some frustrating parts because of no health pack (and no minimum health reset at checkpoint) - Bad sniper town and tank level - Poor graphics - Locked 4:3 aspect ratio - Short draw distance;;- Great music and sound - Good mission variety - Decent enemy AI - German speaking Nazis;Held up well with some room for imrovement (EA pls remaster);35434;293242

3594;;Everything about this game is a solid improvement over GTAIII: better story with far more interesting and diverse characters, more enjoyable city to explore with side-missions that feel fleshed out, and a soundtrack that kicks the pants off of pretty much every other GTA since its just hits of the 80s.  The only thing that really holds this game back is the shooting controls- they SUCK so bad, especially when youre trying to shoot INDOORS- this wouldnt really improve to an acceptable level until GTA4 in my opinion and makes the older entries so cumbersome to play with regards to running and gunning.  Otherwise, this game is a fantastic on pretty much every front.

3596;;If you are going into this and expecting another CTR, you are going to be disappointed. If your expectations are: a kart racer, a sequel to CTR by a different company, using the same mechanics as the original, and new tracks - you are going to have several hours of fun. Its definitely more challenging than CTR, the tracks are not as good or memorable, and controls feel awkward, but - its still a Crash racer superior to other kart racing games on the market  even 16 years after the original release.;1193;;Awkward controls Challenging (sometimes too much) Simply not as good as CTR;;Crash vibes Kart racing Characters Adventure mode;c;47814;295049
3597;;The Wrath of Cortex looks like a cheap copy of Crash Bandicoot: Warped. Although some levels are innovative and fun, some are boring, and lack intelligent game design.

First Thing I noticed there are nowhere as many destructible objects like in just cause 3 or 2 in that fact and they are not really important as in 3 or 2 (As they were needed to take over bases), This leads to my second point, The base system doesnt really exist anymore at least as it did, and thats what I loved about the previous games is the destruction and taking over of bases. Overall this game was pretty disappointing and even with the newer update still not as good as it should be.;103261;;No Destruction Map Is Limited Especially at the beginning  Gets boring quickly;;Massive Map Ok Graphics good vehicle types;c;50258;296058

The Story is amazing took a step forward from GTA 4 for example and introduced 3 characters that you could easily switch to unlike in the GTA 4 DLC Pack episodes from liberty city which let you play all the DLCS. Also, the old-Gen graphics are amazing for the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, and the next-gen consoles graphics are just amazing even today 5 years after release on next-gen I still get amazed at the graphics. The Story is good and the Online is superb, apart from the long loading times for online lobbys and even to load the single player. Another problem with the online is the hacker problem, especially on Old-Gen Consoles. Finally, physics are massively improved from GTA 4s weird car physics.;1020;;Long load times for single player and online Slightly glitch at times but it is expected with a massive game like this.;;Good Story Good Online Better Physics Then GTA 4 Good Graphics Very Hard to get bored over Massive map;c;50258;296120
3603;;Just Pure Bliss in a game. How Can I start  Uses the source engine which is an amazing game engine fall stop and has a seemingly infinite amount of mods.  The Playability is just amazing it lasts forever you will never get bored. The multiplayer is amazing to just play with your mates to playing on a Prophunt server or RP server or a Sandbox server just messing around. The 2 Problems I have with the game is the hassle of having to install the mods that you need to even be able to play on a server as it will take a while and if you have a game full of mods it gets hard. Finally, it is prone to crashing with lots of mods installed. If you have a few Quid Or Dollars laying around Buy this game straight away all the mods are free and constantly updated by the loving community.;3278;;Prone to crash with lots of mods Having to install all the mods to be able to pretty much play the server;;The Infinite amount of mods The Playability lasts forever The source engine full stop The Community is amazing Good Multiplayer  All the mods are free apart from 2 examples and constantly updated.;c;50258;296124
3605;;Superhot has the innovative mechanic whereby time only progresses when you move. Its marketed as a first person shooter, but its really more of a puzzle game. The story is a mix of 1984 and Transcendence, but is not interesting and gets in the way of the gameplay. The levels require a very high level of concentration and the gameplay gets repetitive. There are also a few difficulty spikes, like the Elevator Pitch level.;7205;;- Overpriced (4 hours for 20 bucks) - Bad story - Gets repetitive;;- Innovative mechanic - Great art;Innovative, but repetitive;35434;296335

3613;I still cant say that I think that Kingdom Hearts III is an objectively good game. It does some things very wrong and some things super right, but it balances out somewhere in the grey area of being average to me. Nonetheless its one of the better games in the franchise and I am somehow glad that I was able to accompany the franchise from 2002 to now to see how that whole Xehanort saga comes to a close (most likely).;- Visuals-  I am not a fan of how the characters look in the new artstyle. While environments, animations and particle effects look great, many character models with a more cartoonish origin appear like well animated plastic, especially Mickey and Donald look absolutely awful in my opinion. For modern CGI Disney movie characters on the other hand this new artstyle works just fine. The Tangled, Toy Story and Frozen worlds look fantastic and so do the characters, but as soon as you play through worlds from traditionally animated Disney movies like Hercules, you see how much the new artstyle hurts these characters.  - World Design -  Most of the worlds you are visiting feel really uninspired, boring and even rushed towards the end. They are either open world, HUB based with missions to carry out or corridors without any branches allowing for exploration, outside of occasionally being able to find a chest here and there with mostly nothing interesting in it. The Pirates of the Carribean world for example is huge for a Kingdom Hearts world and invites you to explore it to your heart‘s contend, sailing from island to island. Question here is, why would you want to do that? There is nothing interesting to find anywhere. The islands are all very similar to each other and finding upgrades for your pirateship don‘t net you anything outside of that particular world, because you can‘t use the ship anywhere else. No matter what kind of world you are visiting, all of them feel empty and dull. While I liked the Tangled world the most, I cant say that I really liked any of the worlds to be totally honest, and since visiting these worlds makes up 3/4 of the game, it is quite a huge letdown. The Gummi Ship missions are replaced by another open world-esque area, where you can move freely between the accessible worlds, find optional treasures, challenge strong heartless space ships and set new records for missions. None of it is engaging or even remotely interesting and the shere size of it combined with the very slow speed of your vessel makes navigating from world to world very tedious. The Gummi Ship missions are probably one of the first features many Kingdom Hearts fans would like removed from the game, because no matter how the developers change them up, they always feel unfun and unrewarding to play. The new aspect of being able to run up walls, hence allowing the level designers to experiment more with verticality in the levels, never feels like more than a floaty and clunky gimmick and doesn‘t add any more depth to the world designs.  - Writing -  Pacing is the major writing problem of Kingdom Hearts III. Plotwise it is supposed to be the big finale of the Xehanort saga, the ultimate clash with the main villain and his organization, built up since the first game from 2002. But instead of fueling that tension by putting more emphasis on that final battle, the game just occasionally throws story bits your way and forces you to grind through the Disney worlds, barely advancing in the overall plotline. The final act, my personal highlight of the game, then comes very suddenly and is shoved down your throat in around 5 hours. What I really liked about Kingdom Hearts III though was, that it actually managed to tie in every single prior entry and important character in the series into the main plot of the game without it feeling forced or unnatural. I didnt even know, that I cared about some of these characters, until I saw them making a comeback in Kingdom Hearts III. I was genuinely happy to see them, going through major nostalgia and feeling sympathy for these characters I didnt know I had in me. Especially the villains go through more character development in a couple of minutes in Kingdom Hearts III than in hours of previous games, making them alot more likeable and relatable. Even worse that all this happens during the way too short final act. The bad news for newcomers to the series are, that you almost have to play through all previous Kingdom Hearts games or atleast know the story of them to really understand what is going on. The writing itself is very Kingdom Hearts-esque, so a bit clunky, cheesy and clumsy, but out of all Kingdom Hearts games this game has by far the best writing. The humour works more often than not, the animations during the conversations make them less dull and the word exchanges are way shorter, more on point and have a better flow. The ending of the game itself is as emotional as I anticipated it to be without needing a tearjerker at the end. It triggered a mix of relief and happiness in me, after all these years waiting for it and feels like a well done closure to that long road of the Xehanort saga. I can‘t say that the game has lived up to my expectations when it came to the writing, but the cutscenes after the final battle fullfilled me greatly and I‘m happy they made them exactly how they were, a bit of reconciliation, not a full happy ending and a massive tease towards the next arc of the series with a fantastic reveal. The soundtrack isn‘t as phenomenal as it used to be in Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, but it is still far above average. Thank you, dear composer team and of course Utada Hikaru, for the amazing and iconic music elevating every moment in the series to a new level.  - Gameplay -  If you have finished the oldschool Kingdom Hearts games, which you most likely have because otherwise it makes no sense to play Kingdom Hearts III at all, dont play this game in anything lower than Pride Mode. Kingdom Hearts III is probably the most unchallenging game of the entire franchise and straight up boring on standard difficulty with the game almost playing itself, when you hammer the attack button enough. Another contributing factor to that is the developer‘s decision, that you need completely overpowered moves in your arsenal to make even bosses a complete breeze. Some of the situation commands, summons and especially high level magic make most battles trivial and most mob fights messy and cluttered with a special move being followed up by another special move and so on. Most of the time you don‘t even get to finish a standard combo with your keyblade, before a new special move presents itself, waiting for you to trigger it. The patched in Critical Mode is an absolute godsend here, it is demanding but still fair and satisfying. Probably the absolute worst aspect of the entire game are the tons of unskippable, terribly designed minigames you are forced to play in almost every world you visit. They feel like fillers to drag out the game, so you have to atleast get 20+ hours in to finish it. For everyone, who wants to spend more time in the various worlds of Kingdom Hearts, there are optional activities like completing a photo collection, finding new ingredients to cook and hidden micky mouse symbols or the already mentioned minigames and Gummi Ship quests one can tackle. Sadly, like so often, most of these optional features seem like forced content to inflate the potential playtime of the game with very redundant and sometimes even time wasting quests, adding nothing substantial to it. But there are also positives. Every keyblade has transformations, unique finishers and shotlock commands now, so every keyblade actually feels different from the other, outside of minor stat boost changes, look and range. Also you can equip three keyblades at the same time and swap between them, depending on the situation or what you feel more comfortable with against a certain enemy type. This adds variety, helps craft your own playstyle and works very snappy, feeling very natural and well implemented into the overall very fluent combat. Outside of the clunky wall climbing and the Gummi Ship segments of the game, the controls in general are as nice and responsive as ever.;2933;Mixed is the best word to describe how I feel about this game, not because of it being average the entire way through, but because of it swinging from absolutely terrible to something a Kingdom Hearts fan has been waiting for for years.;1.

3620;;The gameplay is awesome, but whats with the kits, My favourite team is chelsea, they dont have the alternate kit for them, and also the huge disappointment is the inaccuracy of champions league and europa league trophy, if any of you have a solution for this, kindly let me know, other than that i loved the game simply because i am a football fan.;27081;;Kits, and inaccuracy of trophies.;;Gameplay was nice, Character detail was on the mark, great graphics.;c;50646;297450
3622;If you happen to have the remastered version its definitely worth a play for sure, after all the gameplay and the setting at still fantastic. if you dont, i personally dont think it adds enough to go out of your way to buy it separately.;I just recently finished the Uncharted 4 Expansion (The Lost Legacy) and that was surprisingly a lot lengthier than i was expecting. Left Behind on the other hand you can wrap it up in 2 to 3 hours, which left me feeling wanting more for sure.   Aside from that minor gripe, the content itself delivers a few extra insight from the main story.. but not a ton either to be honest. It touches up on a few bits but it feels more like a tease than a fully fleshed out secondary storyline unfortunately.   Gameplay wise, identical.;11790;I hadnt played the expansion back on PS3, so i picked up the Remastered on PS4 for this very reason. I was hopping a bit more from it if im honest.. Lets see.;incredibly short lived;48;grim despair friendship;Short but sweet;3723;297453
3623;;Great game, loved to see how the character got built, gameplay was decent, certainly an improvement from altairs version. But the progress can be tiring, depends on the mindset. certainly not an all & out action game, needs patience.;127;;Lack of action sometimes tests the patience.;;Superb character development and gameplay;c;50646;297454
3624;;Beautiful game, how it allows you to form and train your own group of assassins is genius, the story line and plot progress is so wide that it takes ages to complete the game, but thats what you should expect from an adventure game, its a classic simply because of Ezios involvement. The gameplay has been improved from the previous version which is welcoming;113;;Not much...;;Better gameplay, Exciting changes and expected character development;c;50646;297455
3625;;Ezio deserved a tribute for his contributions for the franchise and Revelations is the best way to make sure he got it. The best thing about Revelations is that how they finished the Desmond saga by not finishing (Spoiler - so im gonna stop there), but it was an exciting end to Ezios journey as an assassin. The changes made in this game are so vast that you forget about all the previous versions of the game, theres more tactic involved, more strategies to plan for and certainly the action and environmental settings of various missions are breathtaking.;537;;There is nothing negative in Revelations (FOR ME);;The character build, costumes, new weapons and strategies to try and particularly the environment and plot progress.;c;50646;297457
3626;;Such a short game, the story line was interesting at first then took a sour turn along the way, despite so much action to enjoy in the game, the fact that this game is so short pisses you off. Great game but sadly it ends too quickly.;7081;;Stealth gameplay needs to be improved, Too short.;;Great shooter, Wide range of weapons and mods available.;c;50646;297458
3627;;Incredible game, breathtaking surroundings, pure action/stealth combination with an average storyline. The game was popularized by Vass and boy it was amazing to experience such an unique antagonist in a first person shooter. The game is an awesome combo of adventure and action and takes a lot of skill to master. Its a fun game which takes you back to the very first version of forest survival, but this time its better. Though I loved the change of scenery and plot in Far cry 2, i Still loved the third installment despite of it being in a familiar surrounding.;529;;Plot is not that good.;;Aweosme gameplay graphics, wide range of weapons to choose from so are the mods, stealth gameplay is interesting too.;c;50646;297459
3628;;Great game  awesome story, good game mechanics, wonderful open world. Its a smaller version of GTA in a school setting. The only downside would be no checkpoints (sometimes missions take 10+ minutes, and starting all over again can be annoying), especially when missions get tougher. I would love to play a sequel.;2720;;No checkpoints in missions;;Great story Good game mechanics Open world;c;47814;297558

3631;;A very charming simple JRPG from start to finish.  The graphics were really charasmatic, despite being 2D sprites, and I was really impressed with how slick it looked for an old N64 game.  My only criticism was that a lot of the mechanics were sometimes TOO simple, i.e. not very challenging.  Some parts could be tricky with strategy, but very rarely.  Plus, you just get FAR too many items and power ups not to succeed.  Regardless, was a fun jaunt- maybe even better than Super Mario RPG in some ways!

3632;;finally on PC and just as wonderful as ever. that being said, because im a PC gamer i have only first played it AFTER playing both Abzu and Flower (having both been released on PC previously). Next to Abzu it seems a tad bland, however, next to Flower, one can see the leaps and bounds made by the game developer in order to create this masterpiece of music and magical visuals.;1352;;Nothing exclusive, new, or special to the PC version (at least not that ive noticed, correct me if im wrong). having had to wait seven bloody years, i wouldve liked a little extra pizaz in my PC release but maybe im asking for too much.;;PC compatibility.;c;4224;297781
3633;;Gameplay: Love it, brings me back to Shemune, especially with the save points being a physical object. Soundtrack: Amazingly cheezy. Sound Design: Every punch has an impact and rush mode makes you feel like ♥♥♥♥♥ about to go down! Story: As goofy as the Trailer was, this has a real serious tone to it. Mixed in with the hilarous cutscenes and drunkards, this balances itself well when the game should be goofy and fun, and have a dark, serious and gripping narrative for the player to delve into.  After a few hours of playing this game, I do highly recommmend it, and it a really good port from the PS4. Although I did have some issues with Audio lag and my CPU bottlenecking when V Sync was turned off, I also do, like what the game says, to play this with a controller (I used a DS4) as there were times where it was much easier on my hands to use the controller rather than reach across the keyboard to smash a key only to not make it in time.

3636;;Doom has by far the most fun gameplay in any game I’ve ever played. It’s very re-playable, I’ve played the campaign 3 times. Doom also have one of the best soundtracks of any game ever made in my opinion.

3642;Highly recommended for anyone looking for either: -a high quality indie game -a great classic gaming throwback experience -a light hearted fun.;Steamworld as a series is a great example of modern platforming in my opinion, it encapsulate a lot of that retro classic nintendo-like era into a neat package. It has vibrant art style, snappy humour, great tight controls and some innovative gameplays.   Playing through Dig 2 in particular is a pure joy as far as classic gaming experience goes in my opinion. I felt transported back to Saturday morning playing games as a kid, its a great feel good sort of game. It also improved vastly on most of the elements of the original.  One thing that was particularly apparent is how the grind is pleasant to go through. while you have to go back to town frequently to unload your findings and inventory,the back and forth never felt a chore as you always leave with something new creating an incentive to keep on going. And im definitely not a fan of grind and repetitive back and forth in gaming usually.  One obvious negative was that i was surprised when i reached the end of the story. i wrapped up the main quest in just about 8hours. Sure theres still a lot of collectible to be found, but i didn t expect it to be so short.;27433;The original Steamworld Dig was one of the best thing i played on Vita, and after recently loving Steamworld Heist i couldnt wait to try Dig 2.. and it did not disappoint  :);fairly short :( a tad on the easy side;130;tight controls and buttery smooth gameplay soundtrack great humour collectibles Its a Steamworld game!;Another win for the Steam series;3723;295671
3643;;Before I uninstall Apex Legends, I am going to leave some notes about this game. Personally, I cant say this game sucks, because I am suck playing the Battle Royale shooter game, so in case of curiousity. I play the game for sake of tasting the bits of Battle royale hype and current trend for gaming mode.   Generally, the game is well polished and has astonishing look with its realism. I am not familiar with the campaign cause its said the story or lore based on Titanfall which I am not interested to play.   People say a game sucks because they dont know how to play it. And this game takes a lot of aspects I dont really like. I can shoot people and have fun with it. But playing a game where you have to run for 10 minutes and get gun where a final moment to win the game based how last you kill someone or get killed bores me sometimes, but why I still play it? Because Apex has particular skill with each characters where this game combined Hero shooter mixed with battle royale.   Unfortunately, playing the game several times makes this game becomes so stale and nothing new to improve player experience where win based on luck and doing nothing on empty arena where players just run and loot some boxes (So, its not fast paced shooter which I dont like).   The characters design seems okay-ish but I predict it will not make developer getting successful skins selling with just bland recolor and not enough waifu (so if you want to some cute girls or sexy women) this has no sign for you. I hate generic pretty boy and girl character design in most of Battle royale mobile though, but i dont know it seems the characters are just being there, but still each players have its own skill where player can master to help winning the game.   So, based my judgement for 5 hours playing and trying this game, I can say this game has potential, but considering BR is just a fad like fidget spinner, I can say this game is good fidget spinner where at first you are impressed with its looks, but get tired everyone make their own fidget spinner.   6.6/10;114795;;character design are not for selling skins;;well polished game;c;38235;298602

3646;;A very well made flight combat game that TRIES to have a deep story in the background, but really only shines when the flying is happening.  Overall, its very well made (looks and sound great) and feels very fast paced.  Theres very little downtime, but thats the point.  Its one of the most accessible flying combat games ever and while it isnt that deep, is very fun and engaging from start to finish.  Even wante4d more by the end, which is a good sign.

3647;;this is a game ive started playiing a billion times but never got around to finishing. this run took me roughly 30 hours, starting at the start of the month and ending tonight (3:55am as i write this). some aspects of the game felt a bit tedious although as a whole it was a good experience - although a walkthrough is necessary if youre as forgetful as i am! some of the videodrugs were really visually interesting and the soundtrack is a classic. ive been trying to finish this game since like 2014 so im happy ive finally done it;2899;;;;;c;50730;298824
3648;;Heres the deal - back in the day, it must have been a fantastic game for the whole circle of friends and family, sharing tips and tricks where to find items, how to progress, or what to do. For a single player experience without a guide or a walk-through, this game is a nightmare. It is hard to rate. I decided to beat it because of its importance to video games in general.

3651;;Absolutely loved this one due to remembering it fondly at the arcades at the Jersey Shore as I grew up. Beyond the variety of Xenomorph species and the varied game play from each playable character, youre in for a good time with some friends. Its a two player cabinet but not being as difficult as most beatem ups of the time, its a blast and kinda easier on the wallet. At each credit coming in at $ .25 and netting you 2 lives per, I was able to complete the game by myself with $1.50.;13679;;Dated mechanics.;;Variety of Xenomorphs. Entry level beatem up.  Varied game play with 4 playable characters.;c;51194;299463
3652;;Really fun game, featuring a nice single player cup-style tournament mode. Fifa Street was probably really inspired by this one!;2256;;Wears off quickly;;Fun Single-player mode Multiplayer;c;47814;299564
3653;;Brilliant atmosphere in this game. Far more accessable than the previous fromsoft games which makes it a much better starting point for most players. The world and the creatures in it are so well imagined and create a world thats completley drew me in. The combats is very fun and deep, the focus on aggressive combat made an enjoyable change from the slower more cautious souls games. Be warned it is pretty hard, but if you take time to learn the mechanics then none of it is unreasonable. You can also use summons, level up more and use online info to get an upper hand if struggling, so the reputation as unbelievably hard is a bit overegged. Overall it was an immersive exciting world to experience and a tight combat system gave me some brilliant challanges that felt great to overcome.;7334;;;;;c;16595;300248
3654;;The game just hasnt aged that well. It feels pretty clunky and for a cyberpunk style game it doesnt look good. The story was okay but nothing inspiring. I felt like the choices I made about my character had little effect on the story, the world or the gameplay. That said there was nothing especially bad, so for someone who enjoys these types of games its worth playing but not a standout game in any way.;3020;;;;;c;16595;300250
3655;;A pretty unique and sincere game. Its a short story about a young woman falling in love for the first time. It feels like a very heartfelt and personal story. Its not gameplay heavy, you ust kind of explore the computer and then theres these MMO style sequences which are not engaging to play at all, but they dont really need to be because the voice chat playing over it is the main aspect here. My main issue with this game was the acting quality, it definitely held back the storytelling.;14702;;;;;c;16595;300251
3656;;Very cool horror game. It heavily taps into the 80s/stranger things/ twighlight zone nostaliga vibe and pulls it off well. The game has four individual stories in which you interact with 80s technology (old computers, scientific equipment etc) in scifi horror stories. Theyre very SCP style horror stories which arent really trying to make you jump, more give you that sense of dread from experiencing something unnatural. It pulls this off brilliantly and at the end goes down a really clever route with some pretty heavy plot content.;27094;;;;;c;16595;300252
3657;;Minit is a very inventive game, respawning every 60 seconds creates some unique and engaging puzzles. It has a fun and simple style and you kind of explore the world in a metroidvania style, using new equipment to get past a barrier in a previous area and then obtaining a new shortcut or item. Its a very short game, but its a tightly made game and doesnt really repeat much. The puzzling isnt super hard, in fact it was quite intuitive. I mostly got through things pretty quickly but felt statisfied by finding the solution. I really appreciated how fresh minit felt, how different it was to most games. Definitely worth a try.;26970;;;;;c;16595;300253
3658;;Its a nice game but for me a step back in the Sims franchise. Its true you have more objects, more clothes, character features, furniture etc., but I feel more limited because I cant truly modify suroundings. It seems more advanced than previous The Sims but its a fasade. Gameplay is poorer, interactions less readable, events not much engaging. I played The Sims 4 and it is a relaxing, nice game but in comparison with previous parts I dont see any big improvement to The Sims 3. It became boring to me quite fast which never happened with part 1, 2 or 3. The Sims 4 is supersaturated on so many levels. Like creators wanted to make it more diversed they drowned themselves in it. Last Sims are a disappointment to me.;3212;;become boring quite fast step back in The Sims series everything is to much gamer is more limited;;interesting new features relaxing still The Sims;c;39817;300435
3659;;The game is fantastic in so many ways, it has good puzzles and the way new items unlock and characters reappear in new areas makes exploring the spooky castle compelling. The aesthetic is great and I genuinely was scared by enemies. I felt really intruiged by the games premise and story telling and desperately wanted to unpick what was going on. But there is a fatal flaw that frustrated me to the point I had to uninstall it. The only way to save is with the gold coins you find around the castle. Theyre pretty limited and you also need them to unlock items in the game. This meant that I had to save them up to progress but in doing so I would have to go long stretches without saving and mutliple times I died and lost a huge chunk of progress, forcing me to replay the same sections I had just beaten. This ruined the entire experience. I cannot reccomend this game at all since the save system completely. undermined everything I enjoyed so much. At this point Ill probably just watch a playthrough to see the rest of the game rather than waste any more time replaying parts I already did.;21767;;The god awful save system that ruined an otherwise enjoyable game;;Almost everything;c;16595;300439
3660;;This was a really moving short story. I loved the premise (two scientists altering a dying mans memories so he can die happy). The story was really well done with entertaining dialogue and likeable characters. It also treated some important topics, such as end of life care and autism, with a lot of sensitivity intelligence. The only drawbacks I had for this game were the controls being a little clunky, some repetitive puzzles at the end of sections (although they dont take long and there arent that many) and at first I really hated the art style which looks very bland and to make it worse most of the game happens in memory sequences where a filter washes out the little colour it had to start with, though I got kinda used to it by the end and it didnt spoil a really moving story.  All in all its just a fantastic moving story, of the quality you dont often see in games.;5025;;repetitive gameplay visually dull;;moving story entertaining dialogue deep and likeable characters;c;16595;300557
3661;;The main issue I had was that the game got pretty repetitive. It does the papers please style throwing an unmanagable amount of work at you gameplay really well and mechanically it works well. I just started to get bored of writing tickets and the main plot was moving really slowly. When a plot beat does happen, nothing really changes, you get a few lines of text in a phone call and then you just go back to the same jobs youve been doing so far. It is a really good idea I felt it had a limited lifespan without throwing in some more varied content.;18860;;;;;c;16595;300779
3662;;Cool setting and premise for the game. Juggling financial pressures and your quests was really well done. It does get a bit repetitive towards the end and because I found it hard to meet the massive sums needed to complete your family quests I had to replay large parts of the game in order to avoid failure states, which was dull. I really enjoyed the main gameplay of snooping on your tenants but I felt like I was failing a lot because of unforeseeable outcomes (some tenants just murder you if you get one dialogue option wrong) wheras I would rather have felt that failure came from the eroding pressures in your finances and from the government pressure. I also definitely felt like the later tenants were less fleshed out so the game felt shallow towards the end. Definitely worth a play if you enjoy games in the papers please vibe or stories set in totalitarian states.;24905;;;;;c;16595;300780
3663;;Very interesting plot, great graphics and smart puzzles. Its also quite lengthy which gave time to the plot and characters to bevelop. The only  thing that I hated from the begining till the end of the game was Gabriel himself. All those years into gaming, its the first time I run into such a sexist and asshole character. I enjoyed killing him in many times. But, I really enjoyed the game.;7859;Im a huge fun of point and click adventure games, but this was my first time playing Gabriel Knight.;;6;;A Gabriel Knight review;4225;300782
3664;;Famous for its unforgiving difficulty, Castlevania on the NES sees you take control of Simon Belmont on his first adventure through Draculas castle. Over the games 18 levels of spooky platforming, whip cracking action, youll face off against hoards of supernatural enemies from ghouls and bats to psychotic hunchbacks and flying medusa heads that will knock you into pits again, and again, and again. All these enemies are so ruthless that it takes lightning reflexes, patience and muscle memory to get through the levels and even then, its often impossible to avoid getting swooped by an evil raven or  knocked off a platform by some zombie. Not only do you have enemies to contend with, but you also have to beat the clock and if it runs out before you get to the end of the stage, you die. Items that restore health are few and far between, so youre left relying on your own wits to survive rather than counting on extra hearts to drop out of enemies to replenish your health bar. If you somehow manage to make it all the way to the penultimate battle, youll go toe-to-toe against Dracula himself.   Many games of the 8-bit era relied on their difficulty to extend the length of time it took to complete them, and Castlevania is a notorious example of that. If you play on an emulator, make heavy use of your save states but if you play on the original hardware, may God have mercy on your soul. Regardless, its a must play title for any video game fan as the games music is iconic and the level design is great for the time. Its one of the earliest games that managed to draw players in thanks to its atmosphere and challenge and it was so successful that it spawned a series of follow-up adventures across multiple generations. Its one of the greatest games on the NES, an important piece of gaming history and a worthy challenge for even the most hardcore gamer.;1114;;;;;c;51488;300824
3665;;While having the worst looking graphics Ive seen in a game in a long time. Unturned, when looked beyond the surface is a superb Zombie Survival game, greatly surpassing everything else on the Free to Play spectrum of the genre. After clocking in over 200 hours on steam, I can say without a doubt that Its easily my favorite F2P game.   The game does however have its flaws, like how the zombie combat is extremely repetitive and looking for supplies can get boring fast. But the PVP combat is phenomenal, and since the game is surprisingly enough built around the robust Cry Engine, it offers alot of variety in weapon customization and optimization.  I for one, really like it.;7878;;;;;c;51503;300871
3666;;I played this game for 8-9 years, it has been an amazing experience but now it needs quite a bit of work to get it up  off its feet for me to reccomend it to others.;891;;Community, Devs not caring that much about the game anymore;;A nice F2P game, Decent Gameplay whether you want to play casually or competitively;c;51538;301058
3667;;Personally it took me over 2 months to finish this game, still i was never bored of it. Its a fabulous piece game which goes deep into the Sci-fi genre of video games, the plot was so beautifully tailored to the genre that everything about it made sense, it was logical and emotional at the same time, no wonder this game is a success. I loved it to the core.;72870;;Nothing really..;;Gameplay was awesome, tons of characters to experience, wide range of weapons and custom modifications, expansive environment.;c;50646;301103
3668;;Fun game with too much problems.  Since the first global release, this game is plagued with connection issue. Even with players with good internet connection.  This brings us to the AFK players problem. If you play in random, you will meet disconnected players (or they are trolling).   The brawlers are imbalance. Some of them are so strong that when your team face a team that have them — and you will, since the game has bad matchmaking — you will lose. Since the movement of the brawlers are sluggish (and the lag problem), skill dont have much meaning.  How bad is the matchmaking? Well, your team can meet another team that have all the powerful brawler. You will also meet a higher level brawler (your power level 2 brawler can meet power level 10, which has an extra ability).  Control button is bad. Its position keeps changing even though you lock it. So you will have unexpected turn when you do battle. Since theres lag problem, you will also experience delay while youre shooting, shoot in wrong direction, or even dont shoot at all (unresponsive). So, yeah...;55945;;lag, stutter, or disconnected problem  afk and trolling players  imbalance brawlers, bad matchmaking, bad control, bad leveling system (experience is useless), useless stats, and bad customer service (they just dont care).;;Fun;c;50849;298226

3670;Trials fusion is overall great fun. I havent played it multiplayer, and maybe thats an added layer to it but nontheless is a perfect pick up and play for just a few levels on the go and theres enough gameplay to keep you enjoy it. Content wise though.. not so much;The more i played it the more i realised that Trials doesn t have much to do with a Sports game, or even a racing game. Instead, im willing to put it as a Puzzle game.  Once you get through the concept its more about how to approach a level in various ways rather than blazing through it as much as possible.  The gameplay is simple while really challenging. The harder levels can be seriously tough, and require a very precise handling of your bike and the physics. which.... caused some problesm with playing on the Switch. TLDR,  the joycons really could benefit from having a proper trigger for the gas & break to control the bike. Unless playing on the go is your main argument, i would honestly recommend playing it on PS4 or xbox.  Theres a truckload of pointless collectibles, and yes lootboxes. which maybe make sense if you play online, but as i played exclusively solo it had absolutely no value to me whatsoever... meh.;103316;I had heard about Trials before and was always confused why they were so popular.. i think now i see :D;Switch joycon feel inadequate for precise gameplay completely pointless collectibles and lootboxes repetitive;130;Great physics silly nonsense;Wait this is a puzzle game?;3723;301387
3671;;This game has nothing to offer except interesting and expressive design. It tried to be a horror but all weve got are poor, repetitive jumpscares. Good horrors supposed to have addictive and frightening story itself. Plot in Bendy is neuter, predictible and boring. I was psychologically exhausted when playing that game. Part because of the story, part because of a terrible gameplay. Surroundings doesnt respond to players actions, there were so many lags, even after changing options in the menu. I hate when game is unfair to player and that one is. You have to know why some things happened and how it is related to your actions in it. That game is a horrible disappointment. Good concept is not enough to be rememberd as a masterpiece. It seems that creators were lazy and decided that esthetics is all that game needs - the rest can be a mess.;28311;;annoying and unclear gameplay notorious lags plot is boring and predictable trying to be a horror but its not;;Disney aestethics;c;39817;301474

3675;;Rimworld is deep, very deep. When you first start playing the game, it is a bit overwhelming. Luckly there is a little info system that gives you good tips about the various mechanics. However, the UI is pretty clunky  which isnt helped by the complexity of the game. The game is hard to get into, but if youre okay with occasionally looking stuff up online, then its a great game. Time can really fly by in this game, to the point that Im afraid of firing it up again  scared of how you can just loose yourself in it.;9789;;Clunky UI;;Deep Time just flies by;c;35434;301610
3676;;Plot---- Story of this prequel to the first main game is unfortunately quite short. All the events in the game leads up to the first game. The pacing is quite fast, finished it in one sitting. Characters are amazing, each character have their own personality and reactions to events as well as all struggle with various issues that worry them. Making it a very interesting game and easily develop a connection with them. The story itself is quite unoriginal, cat girls and the MC wanting to open a cafe. Its very linear there was barely any choices if any in the game making it just a light reading game. Length was short as stated before, I finished the game wishing it was a bit longer to better connect with the characters.  Presentation----- Visuals are amazing, the characters actually move fluidly on screen, they  bounce, breath  as well as blink. Was completely unexpected and very welcome to see.  Music blended well with what was going on screen as well as with the characters emotion and feelings. Sound FX are not annoying at all. I left them enabled.  Mechanics------ Very easy to use like most visual novels. Unfortunately, there is, at least for me, no replayability value, as there was no choices to get a different ending or branching paths you can take.  ===Plot==== Story- 4 Pacing- 10 Characters- 10 Originality- 5 Linearity- 10 Length- 6 Total Plot = 75%  ====Presentation==== Visuals- 10 Music- 10 Sound FX- 10 Total Presentation =100%  =====Mechanics==== Ease of Use- 10 Replayability- 1 Total Mechanics = 55%  ====Grand Total==== 77%;26654;;;;;c;40319;225880
3677;;Plot---- Plot itself isnt very original. Follow the story of the MC who is the owner of a bakery as well as a few catgirls who love him tremendously. He must contend with both the bakery and the catgirls. The pacing of the game is well done, nothing feels dragged out or cut short. Characters are amazing, lovable and fun to see. Very linear, its a VN game it will be quite linear. Length just the right length to not get bored halfway through as well as not wish that the game was longer.  Presentation----- As stated on Nekopara vol 0. Visuals are amazing and very fluid, music blends well with the mood of the game. Sound FX are by no means annoying. Left it enabled again.  Mechanics------ Very easy game to use.

3678;;Plot---- The Catgirls help out with the Cafe, MC wants to give them a treat by taking them on a date. This game focuses on a different pair of catgirls who always end up fighting with one another but deep down still love each other as family. Well paced, nothing feels dragged out when it shouldnt be or cut short. Characters still all lovable and great to visit within the game. Story or concept itself is not very original but it is well executed. Very linear, you wont be getting lost. And the game itself is just the right length making it not feel like its an impossibly long game to play and read along.  Presentation----- As stated on Nekopara vol 0.

3679;;Plot---- This game actually has a decent story, pretty easy to follow since its well translated. Pacing is well done, one battle is finished, shows a small event that happens to meet up with another fighter until the final battle. Characters are all bland and pretty much the same, they all do different moves and have different types of fatalities. Pretty much Street Fighter just with stripping and other stuff  ͡• ͜ʖ ͡•  So not very original as a concept. The game is very linear, only gameplay is within the combat arena. Length well done, its relatively short.  Presentation----- The visuals have aged really well in fact the characters themselves look as though they could be from a game recently made not from 2002. Music is the normal type of fighting music that blends well with the game. Sound FX was pretty annoying had it disabled.  Mechanics------ Is actually quite difficult to get the controls right, but once you know what button does what its a very easy game to play. Replayability is quite high every characters has a different story arc, which i found very interesting and unexpected.  ===Plot==== Story- 4 Pacing- 10 Characters- 6 Originality- 4 Linearity- 10 Length- 10 Total Plot = 73%  ====Presentation==== Visuals- 10 Music- 10 Sound FX- 1 Total Presentation =70%  =====Mechanics==== Ease of Use- 6 Replayability- 10 Total Mechanics = 80%  ====Grand Total==== 74%;22407;;;;;c;40319;226042
3680;;Plot---- Plot is relatively poor, the game is not fully translated or well translated for that matter. When in english, the pacing was slow, and felt like they were dragging out the chatting just to make a unique story. Characters are well designed similar to the previous game. Not very original similar to other combat games just with some scenes, although in this one you are healing them rather than doing what the title of the game says. Very linear, easy to know where you need to go even when not fully translated. Length, was longer than it needed to be which ended up not being as enjoyable as the previous installment.

3681;;Spotted this game on a list of the Top Cyberpunk Games to Play, decided to have a go at it. Said list referenced both the original and the new 2012 version, so I bought both and played this one first on my Xbox One X (its available as a backwards compatible Xbox 360 game).  Its, well, definitely cyberpunk. About as on-the-nose cyberpunk as you can get.  [Deep, dramatic announcer voice:] The year is 2069... where the megacorps run humanity into the ground... where food is scarce and war is imminent... there are- [Dramatic Pause] -AGENTS...  You get the idea.  I dont wanna go down the whole EA=BAD review trope but, well, its EA, and its a pretty meh game. Shooting is wobbly, running is wobbly, your head: wobbly. Overall the game just feels weirdly wobbly, like youre running drunk pretty much the whole time.  Its not all negative though, as Ill state in the Positive Points section. I just want to leave you with this: was it fun? Yes it was. Will I play again? Nope, Im good.;1006;;First off, movement is not fluid. At all. In fact, you often feel like youre trudging through slime when trying to run. Jumping and clambering (yeah, right) are very clumsy. Also, technically there is a slide mechanic, but boy good luck getting that to work right.  The story is pretty shite. Cyberpunk, more like Cybertrope, amirite? Seriously, literally nothing in this story was unexpected  well, except for one particular characters silky smooth voice drizzling honey in my ears (thats a negative point because this game has no proper right to stir my loins like that while Im in a firefight).  Finally, there is the one truly god-annoying thing I hated to my core. This game being set in EAs version of the future, your brain implant identifies everything around you, at all times. These dumb, intrusive pop-ups identifying the wrench on the ground or the broken beer bottles or literally the staple New York piles of trash made it hard to find objectives while in slow moments in-between firefights.;;First, there is an interesting run-and-gun mechanic that I honestly dont think Ive seen before (you can sprint *and* shoot your pistol), it makes for some high-octane kills and was pretty fun.  Breaching and the bullet-time mechanic were useful, and when sprinting around they made for some honestly cool combo moments. One in particular I remember was a moment of hacking a dudes brain to explode, killing two and downing another, while I threw a grenade to finish him off, turning on bullet time, doing a 180, and sniping two more dudes across the hall, all in the span of 3 or 4 seconds.  Lastly, the soundtrack is pretty killer. Its extremely 2012, but for me thats not a bad thing. Heavy electro and dubstep from the early days of the decade helped set the atmosphere for the intense firefights I found myself in.;c;32979;301899
3682;;That was a lot of fun!!! Loved the script idea. Quite difficult I might add. Most of it is not linear, but some parts are and if you dont do some stuff in order youll pay of it. Literally! Worst thing is all those horrible pointless mazes. Headaces! Lots of them.;106;;;;;c;4225;302131
3683;;That game delighted me. It has its weaknesses but whole story and gameplay are magical. Im especially fond of battle system - something I dont usually see in other games. Soundtrack is not invasive but at the same time very characteristic and fits Transistor well. Thing that made me fall in love with this game is art style and general aesthetics. I could remain in one location for minutes, because I wanted to watch all those beautiful details from buildings, pavements, trees, etc. Also I like how the plot is unfolding before the gamer. You can visit some interesting parts of the city, which are described by a Transistor, then you can interact with OVC terminals and you can find something out about other characters by using Transistor - that idea I liked a lot. Everything is set in some cyberpunk reality, which is a one more reason why Im so excited about that game. I had moments when a felt disappointed or annoyed because situation was unclear, also not everything was explained enough. But what made me especially sad is that game is very short. I think that story could be better if we could have a chance to know more about city, Camerata, other characters. At some point it seems that authors were in rush so they decided to throw away some ideas. Anyway, I will recommend Transistor to everyone who likes cyberpunk and electronics in games. Playing that game is unusual experience.;3022;;too short some ideas couldve been more developed sometimes storys unclear;;unusual and beautiful art style (so many details) great soundtrack very interesting and engaging gameplay battle system cyberpunk reality;c;39817;302113
3684;;No One Lives Forever is a first person shooter with spy elements. I went into the game thinking that it would be all about stealth and useful gadgets. However, the stealth system isnt well designed  leading to you creating massive blood baths everywhere you go. There are plenty of gadgets, but its a pain to equip them and they arent all that effective. Now, the great thing about the game is the humour and this is very well done  making up for the downsides of the game. There rest of the review is just complains, but do realise that it is a great game overall.  The game is nearly twenty years old and currently only available through the revival project done by a couple of fans. One issue I had, was that the rendering while submerged was broken. Online I found that others had the same problem, caused by gpu driver incompatibility. You can try to fix it, or just skip these parts by pressing the talk button (Y) and typing mpmaphole. I did the later option.  Another issue with the game is the level design. Levels are designed in such away that you can approach levels from multiple routes. However, this also makes the levels confusing, because you often dont know which direction to go in. There are also plenty of moments that you have no clue as to how youre supposed to continue and times that you need to find a specific amount of items and spent ages wandering around the level trying to find that last one. The game also has a couple of absolutely terrible vehicle sections, which apparently make a return in the sequel.;897;;- Confusing level design - Underwater rendering broken - Terrible vehicle sections - Mostly useless gadgets;;- Great humour - Decent story;c;35434;302209
3686;;A great throwback to 16-bit era RPGs while even re-introducing it for a new era and showing that so much more could be done with it. Everything in its presentation and battle systems is what I would want with more RPGs done in its style or possibly even remaking some classics.  That said, the big detractor for me, as with many other people, is the overall story and plot. I made my way through all eight characters stories which made for about a 101 hour playthrough, one that had me at times really willing myself to get through it all. Theres a lot of great groundwork here for something more that could be done with it and I hope to see more examples of this done with better execution in the writing and scenario departments.;26765;;;;;c;29411;302402

3688;;A very short game, good effort, and a brilliant idea. I highly recommend to finish in one sitting (so you dont forget what decisions you made), make your assumptions and based on that, progress through the game. Play with purpose, and you will enjoy playing, or even re-playing the game.

Its not only the best story ever written in an MMORPG, but Id stay its one of the best stories I have seen in any RPG in the last decade!

3704;;I didnt like the book so probably thats why I dont like this game either. I hoped it would be more interesting, but for me Metro 2033 is boring as hell. Characters are neuter, I cant bond with them. Story is more like a calque of the story from the book, which was to naive for me and brings nothing new. Fighting style is somehow not polished up, as well as other things in Metro. I dont know, I felt nothing except boredom playing that game. Im definitely not a target for that universum.

3705;;Much like I remember when it first came out, this game was ultimately underwhelming.  It felt like it lacked so much polish that other Squaresoft games of the same era had.  The story was pretty lacking in the depth department, the characters were barebones, and the progression through the game was goofy to say the least.  Felt somehow hollow, BUT I will give it praise for the music- Jeremy Soule was the shining gem in this mediocre mess of a game.

3708;;So here s my review and rating for the game.  Great atmospere and environment. Nature at its best. Some animals could act a bit more realistic. The story of the main game is very interesting and the map is pretty large and provides also side activities and optional quests. There are many places to explore, a huge weapon arsenal with weapon customizations and lot more. A huge con are the bugs. Like in all games, also in this game Ubisoft did not miss to implement bugs to nerv the players once again. The quest of shangri la cause game crash sometimes, and other bugs like missing climb spots etc... However for Far Cry series fans a MUST have. I purchased the gold edition with season pass. I was not very impressed of the season pass campagnes Escape from durgesh prison and valley of the yetis. Espessially the time-based escape the durgesh prison campagne was for me a failure. I did not finish it because i was bored. However in an overall rating I give 7 stars for that game.;53019;;BUGS BUGS BUGS (and crashes), Some slight unrealistic animal behaviors, Boring season pass campaigns (season pass was not worth it);;Impressive main campaign story, Large map with nature highlights, large weapon arsenal customizable.;c;43279;308478
3709;;The story is bland. I know Im not that far into the game (about 1/3) but this is a mix of the most simple excuse for a conflict and the most cliché characters. The characters all look so blase and unaffected about the situation (war!) too. Its almost unsettling. I think the story was about to take a turn but it didnt interest me enough to continue. The gameplay is pretty unique afaik. Its comparable to tactical RPGs but there are some major differences. You can see your troops on a map. You can only see the world (in 3D) when you select a unit to move (losing an action point doing so). There is no indication of the distance the unit will be able to travel or any range indicator. This makes it very difficult to make any well-thought decision. I always felt my decision-making to be so random, even if it ended well more often than not. The squad management is pretty deep but its so overwhelming I just made random choices (again). You can supposedly chose your personnel based on preferences (literally: this soldier likes this soldier) and abilities (e.g. favors girls). Im not willing to dive in and make a squad of 20 soldiers that all like each other just for the sake of it. I had no problems finishing the missions while not even looking at all that. The game does a pretty bad job at explaining its mechanics. I rage-quitted the battle in the 7th chapter and uninstalled for this very reason. I did something that should have a particular effect I expected. It didnt. You can skirmish to level up your squad and your equipment. The amount of skirmishes that are available is particularly low (3 after 6 chapters) and are just revisits of battles on maps youve already won. Lame. Maps are simplistic and empty.;7477;;;;The graphics and visual style of the game were definitely the main contributors to the games appeal for me. The anime graphics are gorgeous, both in cutscenes as in gameplay.;c;50957;308601
3710;;Interesting short sci fi story. The game all takes place on one subway car. You are a detective robot trying to figure out robot dissapearances. The game basically involves exhausting dialogue options until the other robots leave, so in terms of mechanics its not great. However if you like high concept sci fi stories then this will do the job. I was genuinely interested in the dialogue and wanted to find out more about the world it takes place in. I think they did a good job at creating varied and interesting characters and a cohesive world with a consitent and engaging style.;54780;;;;;c;16595;308870

3712;I could almost say the same as for most Yakuza games. The writing, characters, story and humour are a staple of the series and the reason why anyone would touch these games, while the rest serves as a legitimate argument of never wanting to try the series. Judgment nailed the characters, the story and partially the writing and the humour, while still suffering immensely from the same flaws which plague the majority of the franchise. The big differences are the dumbed down combat, the inconsistent tone and the comparably average soundtrack, which make me like entries like Yakuza 0 quite a bit more than Judgment, eventhough I am not calling Judgment a bad game by any means. If you are a fan of the Yakuza series this game is most likely for you, but if you arent, then Id suggest trying a Yakuza game first to get the general gist of things.;- Visuals &amp  Performance -  A Ryuga Gotoku game has never looked better than this. The motion capture is amazingly implemented into cineastic cutscenes, the martial arts sequences look absolutely fantastic and Kamurocho, the secret star of all Yakuza games, has never looked more vibrant, more beautiful and more inviting to explore. Characteristically for the Yakuza franchise there is quite a discrepancy between the visual quality of „important“ main storyline and sidemission cutscenes, ranging from some of the best facial animations in the business to above average last gen console graphics. All in all though the pros outweigh the cons in this case, because generally the game looks great, if you don‘t count these little sidemission hickups. A point which is harder to overlook are the performance issues the game has. Loading times are extremely long, the game stutters a bit here and there and long lasting freeze frames in the middle of the game to load in incoming cutscenes remind of older entries in the franchise and will most likely never be fully gone from these games.  - Writing -  The tone of the game is a lot tamer and tries to be a more grounded and realistic experience. Unfortunately the game doesnt manage to be consistent in that regard and ends up going from the ridiculousness and over the top feeling of the Yakuza series back to Judgment‘s calmer approach to the franchise, which leaves the player torn between two styles and never really satisfied with either of the two. The character driven story itself is great, but told with a really bumpy pacing. It starts extremely slowly, taking very long to introduce all important characters and relevant story strands, while sending you on exhausting and unnecessarily long and boring tailing and drone flight missions, fetch quests or straight up lets you wait for events to happen without being able to speed up the process. On the other hand the story creates an amazing suction effect the further you get into it, partially justifying its slow and detailed build up, but not the pointless distractions thrown your way to artificially stretch out the playtime needed to finish the main storyline. But the writing is definitely not Judgments problem. Almost the entire cast is memorable, likeable or generally well written, the story has twists and turns, the humour, despite not being as hilariously crazy as in the Yakuza series, is well placed and subtle and the last 5 hours do a fantastic job weaving all the loose strings into one well done final act. Especially the smaller cast of villains is more down to earth and has more room to develope than in the majority of the Yakuza games, which is a very welcome change. The side missions however are very neglectible, since most of them dont provide the unpredictable silliness of the Yakuza side missions and end up being quite generic and boring. There are some exceptions, but those are rare. But I am not going to lie, when this game hits, it hits hard. Some of the moments in this game ran chills down my spine, because they were so emotional, superbly directed and scenically well done. The phenomenal cast performing the motion capture for the game with its stunning acting in particular and the movie-worthy directing and camera work elevated these moments to the next level. Also it has some of the best martial arts choreographies I have ever seen in a video game or any medium in general. The only gripe I have with how the characters are written is the fact that the protagonist Yagami, who is supposed to be a former lawyer and not really fond of physical violence, is as much of a brawler as the Yakuza series protagonist Kiryu, which feels a bit off in the overall feel of the story. Sure the protagonist has to have quite significant fighting abilities to make use of the Yakuza formula, but it doesn‘t jell well with how Yagami presents himself and acts at all.  - Gameplay -  The gameplay really drags the rating down for me. As in all Yakuza games the controls are quite clunky and dated, making even the simplest things like opening doors an unnecessarily fiddly task, while you bump into every lifeless passerby possible on the streets of Kamurocho, because of all the endless running through the city you have to do to advance the plot. Only the beauty of the setting makes the running around bearable and not a complete mood killing fiasco. The combat is more fluid and feels better than in most other Yakuza games, but got oversimplified, losing a significant amount of depth, just like the ability skill tree. Combat difficulty is handled better than in any Yakuza game though. Bosses unleash different moves or pressure you harder, after you chipped away a part of their health, while in most Yakuza boss fights the boss just gets tougher by randomly super armouring through your attacks, hitting you with the same exact moves, which feels cheap more than anything. The biggest downside for me is, that, if you take away all the context of why you are doing something, the actual gameplay is terribly repetitive, despite adding new gameplay quirks here and there like the wall attacks, newly added mobility and being able to take fights into buildings by breaking windows or doors. Your sparetime activities are also very limited compared to the likes of Yakuza Zero. Some of them got recycled like playing darts or the baseball batting cages and fortunately also the old Sega classics you can play in the arcades, but things like the Karaoke bars are sadly gone. The new dating function and friend system is nothing to write home about either, some of it has its little moments, but I personally wouldnt miss most of them if they were gone from the game entirely. Another major nuisance are reoccurding mobs of enemies hindering you simply roaming the streets, trying to wrap up a side mission, purchasing healing items or just wanting to progress the overall story. That has been there since the first Yakuza game, but Judgment takes this problem to new heights with the introduction of the threat level. More often than one would hope, a gang invades Kamurocho and attacks the player at pretty much every corner in the street, dragging out advancing whatever you are doing at the moment by entangling the player in meaningless street brawls again and again. One either has to beat the leaders of the gang spread across the city again and again or endure the permanent onslaughts, until the threat level has dropped below zero again, which takes quite a while and is an annoyance more than anything. Also the aforementioned newly added gameplay elements feel not quite thought through. Tailing and chasing subjects, finding clues and investigating with your drone sound like decent additions and make sense, considering you are a detective after all, but are executed so half assed and feel so non-commital and unexplored, that they almost end up being disruptive to the overall pace of the story. Mostly you just want to get it over with to learn what happens next in the gripping story, but are forced to play through badly designed minigame-esque sequences to get to the next vital point of the story. Same could be said for the multiple choice system they implemented, where you choose a response during conversations or at critical moments in the story. Whatever choice you decide to make doesn‘t matter in the end. The game forces you into the direction it wants you to go, even if it is the option you disagree the most with. If you choose the „wrong“ answer, one of the involved characters or Yagami himself will just object and kick you back into the select screen, until you pick the „right“ choice to advance further. The only payoff you get from choosing the path the game wants you to go right off the bat is a flimsy EXP bonus, which is oftentimes smaller than what you get from beating up the weakest mob in the game. I sincerely don‘t understand, why you have your player choose between different routes and then force him on the necessary route to advance the plot, when you can have a continuing cutscene instead, giving the moment a more cineastic feel, rather than pretending there is something like different outcomes to the situation.;109274;Yakuza Light with a pinch of Ace Attorney and a taste of L.A. Noire describes best how I felt about this game. While this could‘ve been a promising genre mix, the game sadly never fully commits to its newly introduced detective elements and resorts back to the tried and trusted Yakuza elements, which is a back and forth most players won‘t find actual fullfillment ín.

There are ghosts (dooh) chasing you at times and you must flee before they kill you. There are safe rooms to hide and where you be able to save the game. The story is about you searching for youre missing friends/crew that got lost(?) in the big mansion. Search for different keys to open the many doors in the big house and some smaller puzzles. Spooky soundeffects that gets you goosebumps. I have played the game for 11 hours now and im halfway so theres a good length of the gametime with much content.

3722;;I seriously dont understand how anyone can recommend this game! I understand that it was the first in a phenomenal series and was the first to introduce the assassin gameplay that we now know, love and cherish, but this game is just dreadful!  Pros: - I enjoyed the revelation at the end - Introduced the base assassin gameplay, the series is known for - Combat was decent for the most part, if not a bit slow, tedious and frustrating  Cons: - Combat was for the most part just waves and waves of enemies stood there, whilst you take them out one by one, with a counter.... Especially the final mission.... WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE. - Controls feel extremely awkward! It felt like trying to traverse the city skylines with a plastic bag tied around both feet, whilst also wearing handcuffs. - Missions were SO BORING AND REPETITIVE! There was LITERALLY no diversity in mission structure, other than the prologue and the final mission. It was literally Oh kill this man for us, but first do 3 of the exact same filler missions, to gain intel on them over and over again, all game. - Exploration wasnt rewarding. You can collect some flags, for no reason. Yay. - Horse controls were dreadful - Getting into combat everywhere you went. - Assassinations were limited back in this game, so no jumping assassinations, which it desperately needed. - Story was crap (apart from the ending revelation, which was decent). You do 3 missions, to gain some crappy intel on the assassination target, who you dont know, dont care for and dont even remember their name or what you killed them for. - Colour pallet was bland. (I know the setting and buildings explain why its like that, but some colour would be nice, here and there. - Youre drip fed your abilities, which yeah is good in the sense that youre getting new stuff, but youre just handed it after every mission, so no feeling of progression or worth.  There are probably waaaay more cons I could pick out, but Im just going off the top of my head. Id like to clarify that the other games in the series that I have played, Ive loved! Black Flag is one of my favourite games of all time! This just feels like an alpha version, of the now thoroughly advanced AC games.  For these reasons, Id say save your money and go straight to AC2....;128;;Was just a game of kill wave after wave of enemies, with a bad story, repetitive missions and dreadful controls;;Ending was decent and combat was ok for the most part.;c;52601;310859
3723;;What a wonderful game. I recognize that the game has been criticized for having fluff but I look at Odyssey as a marriage of Mario 64 game play and Rare collectathon sensibilities.

3725;;An all time favorite retro game. Played through it again a few times recently. The music, atmosphere, and gameplay are incredible for the NES. A nearly perfect game. Those that complain about the stiff mechanics dont seem to understand that the game was created with those mechanics in mind. There is a reason why Super Castlevania IV is a bit too easy.   My only nagging flaw with the game is Deaths Hallway on stage 15. That section feels a bit on the cheap side.;1114;;Deaths Hallway on stage 15;;;c;44541;311143
3726;;Played on a Mega SG. Huge improvement over the first game. Almost every part of the game has been improved. Most of the levels/zones present here are designed for speed. The music is every bit as good as the first game. Though I think I prefer the first OST. The visuals are a huge step up. Everything here feels so much more detailed with colors that really pop.   Holding this game back for me though is Metropolis Zone and the final boss area Death Egg Zone. Metropolis Zone feels designed from the ground up to annoy the player. The enemies themselves not only have the quickest attacks in the game, the odds are stacked against you by their placement. Finally the final zone of the game features two bosses and no rings. That means you cant recover your rings and that spells certain death for new players. This problem is worsened by both bosses taking a high level of memorization and the continue feature being strict in the game.   Despite my issue with some parts of the later stages it doesnt spoil the game for me. Ive been playing this one on and off since I was six years old. I plan to return to it again down the road.   8/10;4438;;;;;c;44541;311144
3727;I will no doubt be replaying Firewatch, at least in parts, almost in a similar fashion to Journey both aesthetically and peacefully. Im very much looking forward to trying out the free roaming mode, which is a nice touch for the switch especially, a bit of outdoors expedition on the go is great, and hopefully makes the shortcoming of the technical port worthwhile.  Definitely recommend playing with the map marker turned off! The game really turns into a wilderness orienting hike and is great immersion.;Besides the pretty visual and the indie hype around Firewatch i didnt really know much about it, As i found out its very much an emotional journey, the intro scene is deep, heavy and sad.. putting a lot of the weight on the protagonist from the get go. Its almost difficult to digest in that way, but it does a great job at putting you in the shoes of your character by connecting with him.  Gameplay wise, well its a walking simulator so to speak, theres isnt a lot of gameplay mechanic beyond orienting yourself and selecting dialog trees via your radio (which is great!). Early on in the game i decided to turn off the map markers, which im very glad i did! turns what would be a minimal gameplay mechanic is a pure treasure of orienting yourself in the wild, just with a map and a compas, i had a lot of fun of just figuring out where to go solely based on radio instructions alone, highly recommended!  The visuals may not be realistic but this very much acts like a tourism post card for Wyoming, and i would argue that the graphic style would help making the game a long lasting gem many years from now still.;9730;Firewatch is a game worth experiencing.

3734;;Ive never been more than a passing appreciator of the original RESIDENT EVIL 2, and have, in fact, probably said more than once that its a tad overrated when compared to its sharper, more focused predecessor. Im not sure whether that was a help or a hindrance with regards to giving this remake its fair shake, but I do know that this is one hell of a game.   Seems to strike the perfect balance between modern gaming QOL concessions and the survival horror tropes of yore. Its not just another tired RESIDENT EVIL 4 iteration like the dreadfully boring REVELATIONS games, nor is it an RCPD skin applied to the shockingly great RESIDENT EVIL 7, either. No, its its own new evolution of what RE is, and it makes me really excited to see what comes next.

Falters in the storyline/cutscenes/voice acting department, but if were being honest with ourselves, those were never strong points for the CASTLEVANIA series, either. You cant deny they put a lot of effort into it, at least.  Very strong return to form, and hopefully the start of a bonafide new series.

3745;;Perhaps an even greater disappointment then Call of Cthulhu.   Not a horrible game but definitely not what i thought it would be.  The creatures are interesting at first but quickly become repetitive. The game mechanics/innovations such as utilizing deductive reasoning in order to come to conclusions is an interesting idea but i feel that it does not fulfill its potential.  The story is well written but the NPCs themselves quickly become drab and feel less-than-human when compared to the various NPCs that populate games such as those in the Dishonest and GTA franchises. While playing i often found myself underwhelmed, bored, and utilizing a trainer and turning on superspeed simply to get to the next point of interest in a reasonable amount of time.  The city itself is repetitive and the graphics seem outdated.  I really wanted this to be great and would have been okay with it being decent but its not decent...its whatever. i am going to end up shelving it before finishing it and thats a damn shame and waste.   After Call of Cthulhus less then spectacular release and now this, i fear the time has come to give up on Lovecraft ever directly making it to the realm of gaming in a respectable and worthwhile way.  That being said, LovecraftIAN games (Dead Space franchise comes to mind) still seem to hit the mark from time to time and but i will regardless need to start keeping my expectations in check with regards to anything having to do with cosmic horror.;18225;;but is that attempt even worth your time?;;*sighs* its definitely a fleshed out attempt;c;4224;312380
3746;;NOLF 2 improves upon NOLF in several ways, but also fails in other ways. The confusing layout of the levels has been improved. However, the level design is overall worse, since you often need to find one specific item in some remote place. For example in one level you need to get past an electric fence. I expected that there was some way to get around the fence (tunnel or climbing over wall)  instead you have to find a bag of sugar (only 1 bag in the level), back track for a couple of minutes (even a loading screen), go into the basement of a building and poor the sugar into a generator. The only way youre suppose to know this, is because there was a piece of intel that said that guards regularly dissabled the generator this way to get their sweethearts into the compound.  The ways the game improves upon the original, is by removing the clutter of selecting a specific gadget when you need it to progress and the animations and models are much improved. The funny humour also makes a return, though in less quantity. Overall I enjoyed the original more than this one. But you know what they say: third times the charm, only the third one never came.;820;;- Bad level design - Terrible vehicle sections (again) - Not enjoyable India chapters;;- Great humour makes a return - Less clutter with using gadgets - Much improved animations and models - More detailed levels;c;35434;312397
3747;;Kerbal Space Program is a lot of fun, but ultimately quite flawed. My main gripe with it, is that you need to look up the dV needed whenever you want to build something (otherwise you cant design it well). The devs have now finally added a display of the dV of the current design, but this is calculated poorly and ultimately Kerbal Redux (mod) is still much better.  The building and piloting is fun, but there isnt much to do at the planets/satellites. At first, your goal will probably to land on every planet and natural satellite. However whenever you land somewhere, youll realise how there is just nothing to do when you get there. Theyve tried to fix this with the Breaking Grounds DLC, but the game needs proper base building mechanics. After landing everywere (or pretty much everywhere) youll likely start setting challenges for yourself, this is the endgame of ksp.  Version 1.3 was pretty stable, but the current versions (1.7) crash often when going into the assembly building. I would recommend it (on PC), but definitely play most of the tutorials.

3748;;Do you like playing first person shooter with small of rpg elements and ability trees, Borderland franchise is what right for you who likes grinding and loot items such rare weapons and items that help you finish the quest or fight boss without too much effort after finishing one side quest to other while you shoot same thing over and over. That’s my impression for every rpg games, and its not bad thing.  Borderland is kind of the game that you hate to play due the repetitiveness in every single quest, shoot and loot by fight against one level up stronger enemies, fetching cryptic items to reveal storyline and also inflated money that is useless to use after getting strong item to equip. And still, players can really enjoy the game theme where you can pick four different class characters which the storyline consist of bounty hunter in wasteland planet called Pandora.   The humourous tone of story-telling that makes killing psycho looks fun meanwhile players get spouted of 00’s meme catchphrase along the game by non-playable characters who are borderline of funny and annoying with the screaming and quips. Its very enjoyable storyline to get to know about an ambitious main boss want to control the planet which personally makes think its great writing of character who makes player chuckle in every single line the boss said any thing.   During the game, players can get to know more stories about character and lore if doing quest where the game relies on audio recording instead of cutscenes, but don’t bother too much doing all the task because some are too hard to do and player have to backtrack in any visited map if the players just want to progress the game only playing the main quest and that’s it, some DLC are worth to play for story but being too dull if players are already over-level because killing enemy will become a chore than challenging, there is something about “BS moment” where sometimes if players are too over-confident to fight against horde of enemy, they are likely become more hard to kill and seems the universe in this game want you to die which cost a lot of your earning money.   Borderland 2 is easy to play the game if players know how to build the skillset and know the role, eventhough I finish the game playing solo, this game can be fun as co-op game because the world and athmosphere of open world with its own unique style gives plus value because its not like AAA 3D games that will age after one decade. So its pleasing game to enjoy with friends or just playing alone.  As sidenote : Borderland 1 has slight different theme where its trying to be more serious game where later the tone in the sequel becomes more light-hearted and funny.;1011;;Repetitive quest with same element of collecting stuff Cryptic fetch quest DLC are pointless Money are too inflated;;Fun and Hilarious touch Ridiculous characters with memorable final boss Challenging to level up Trying to be meme game;c;38235;313381

3752;;An interesting and relaxing sliding puzzle game with a background narrative told through level names, the year indicated and the actions required to complete some levels. For those interested in trying to put it together.  It took me around 5 hours to complete and find everything in the game on Steam.  The goal of the game is to collect all the pearls in a level using the indicated number of moves, though you can go over that number and continue to progress. There is also a jewel hidden in each level, which can be a puzzle of their own due to the steps needed to access some spots. The main game has 84 levels that are split across 7 shelves by year, each shelf has 3 pictures and each picture has a set of 4 levels. New mechanics are introduced on almost every shelf with the difficulty increasing through mechanic interactions and the number of moves required to complete levels. There is a hint system in the game that I didnt interact with, from what I remember it apparently gives a hint for the first token used then shows you the intended puzzle solution for the movement number indicated.   Some levels can be completed in less moves than indicated because of specific mechanic interactions. These small skips mainly matter for the leaderboards that ranks that amount of moves used on each shelf of puzzles. The global leaderboards do have some cheaters listed with impossible scores but it can still be satisfying to see your rank with a group of others that found a skip or simply finished a shelf of puzzles perfectly. There is also an option to compare scores against friends on Steam.;15741;;;;;c;2009;
3753;;I know this is controversial, but here is my problem with this game: I hated every minute I played it. I dont get why it is so popular: perhaps because of its legacy and how it influenced the genre? Its annoying how you get 3 hearts every time you die, how you are ported to the beginning of the dungeon every time you die, how you are supposed to just figure out some things without anything pointing in the direction to it (you will eventually get it, but it is time-consuming for sure). The combat is okay, the controls and camera are awful, the story is great, and some puzzles are creative. I finished the game, but I was bored playing it, I didnt enjoy it.;1039;;Really, really boring Controls Camera Game rules/mechanics;;Story Art style Some puzzles;c;47814;314381
3754;;Super Meat Boy is a good little platformer (very similar to N/N+), which starts easy, but gets very tough eventually. The levels are beautiful, the controls and mechanics are good. If you are into tough platformers, you will enjoy this game for sure (especially the boss battles).

3755;;Having not played any previous games in the franchise i’ve went into this not knowing what to expect  and I have to say this game can be extremely entertaining. I’ve now found myself immersed in the world and its lore while also eagerly anticipating new monsters, events and the new dlc.  While Monster Hunter: World has its flaws I do personally believe that the pure entertainment outweighs the negative points so i’d still recommend this.  Not a GOTY contender but a fun game nevertheless which i’m still playing today.;36926;;• Unecessarily tedious when inviting friends to join a hunt  and the party dissipates after every hunt  • Monsters attack hitboxes too big/inconsistent (mostly apparent while using the insect glaive)  • No real way to control monster aggro  • More of the armour should be available as vanity gear;;• Nice environments  • The monsters themselves are unique and visually appealing  • Core gameplay loop is fun and doesn’t feel overly “grindy”  • Many unique weapons and playstyles to try  • Huge range of wierd and wonderful wildlife to witness and collect for yourself to keep as pets  • Regular updates and events to keep the game fresh  • Palicoes;‘Monster Hunter: World’ Review;40955;231095

3762;;NOTE: Ill only be review the singleplayer portion of this game  Plot----  The Story is very interesting and engaging. It offers the point of view of an Imperial Special Ops trooper and squad as they have to deal with the ensuing Rebel attacks what remains of the Sith Empire.  The story itself isnt very unique the main character like in previous Star Wars games sees the Empire as an evil entity and thus betrays it and some point, defecting to the rebels.  The game starts off strong but then there are many events in the game where i began questioning why on earth they decided to put that into the game.  Many segments of the game tries to stretch out some events thus breaking the pacing of the game.  The characters do not feel very original to me, they felt like vanilla Stormtroopers who ends up questioning the empire and defecting. Other Characters like Luke, Han,Leia, I feel are not well utilized and makes the game feel extremely strange as we often switch characters within the story of Iden...  The concept of the game itself is quite original for the Star Wars universe, seeing what happens directly after the destruction of the Death Start as well as the events leading up to Episode 7 but thats about it. Its extremely linear, you do not get to explore the world or even decide what planet to go to first. Ends up leaving the player feel like they are missing out on the Star Wars world. The length of the game for a Star Wars game is criminally short, you go in ready to dive into a big story of Star Wars, wanting to get connected to the characters and visit all the planets that you potentially can.... but you dont. It was quite clear they either had no idea what kind of content they should put into the game or just wanted to stretch out a short story. It will leave you wanting for a longer more in depth story... then youll remember its EA.   Presentation-----  Its Dice, the visuals are amazing. The attention to detail to rocks, characters likeness, blasters and practically everything else makes the game extremely eye candy and great to look at. Music is great fits very well with the well known Star Wars orchestra type of music. SoundFX is by no means annoying.  Mechanics------  The game itself is extremely easy to play and get used to the controls. As for replayability there is practically none for the single player. Once you beat the campaign there really isnt much to do, the story doesnt change if you replay, everything begins and ends in the same way.

3763;;Plot----  This game pays great homage to the Back to the Future Trilogy. The story is quite different from the movies and features a story that dives into the concept of the events impacting the future in a great new way. The pacing depends on how fast you can solve the puzzles but unfortunately a lot of the puzzles are quite difficult to understand or figure out and it can lead you to using lots of time to figure it out or just watch a walkthrough. The Characters are all very well handled in the care of Telltales making it feel like it is actually part of the characters original story. In a true TellTale fashion the story is very linear and this game was before TellTale decided to do the whole they will remember your choice. The story is quite different and original in comparison to the Back to the Future movies but still finds ways to do it well. Excluding the time consuming puzzles the game itself isnt very long. Its long enough to be content with the story you got.  Presentation-----  The visuals are very unique albeit pretty cartoony but still manages to portray the characters emotions very well as well as offering interesting parts of town in past/present and future. I feel like they could have polished the look a bit more though. The music blends very nicely with the atmosphere of the game, making it very engaging during action scenes.  Mechanics------  The game controls are very similar to other Telltale games and quite primitive compared to some of their bigger titles. Its extremely easy to play but unfortunately the replayability is very low as the story has no branching choices or different endings like TellTales Walking Dead.

3764;;Plot----  The story is well done, you go trying to figure out who rammed their car into you and thus killing your daughter. The story is very interesting and fun to play. The game progresses quite quickly if you stuck to just the main stories, the side quests can be skipped but i personally wouldnt recommend to skip them. The characters that you encounter are well made have a pretty decent backstory to why they are either helping or against you. Id personally say that the game is very original, the only hacker type GTA game ive ever played. The game is in the similar style as GTA series, so its kind of an open world city where you can pretty much do anything you please. The story itself is very linear telling you to go usually from point a to point b. I felt like the length was long enough to be satisfying to finish in the end.  Presentation-----  People were saying it got downgraded. Idk maybe im crazy but i think the graphics looked pretty good, of course not as great as they showed it but still great to look at nonetheless. The music blends extremely well with the atmosphere of the game.  Mechanics------  Some of the reviews are claiming that there is a big learning curve... For me there wasnt much of a learning curve at all. It all felt intuitive, some of the cars though could be a bit better tuned in the game, its very easy to take a car and drift often or skid on the road. The game is quite long and the story doesnt exactly change or alter if you replay it. Only reason to come back to it is if youre a completionist.

3765;;Plot----  The story is really good, and well thought out its somewhat a cross between a dungeon crawler and pokemon and ecchi anime. Its a about a Demon Master who embarks on a journey through dungeons, training her demons and herself in order to bring down Demon King. The game progresses at very fast pace, the game is by no means grindy and is actually fun to train and level up. Characters are alright, you wont exactly share any connection with them. The is quite uninspired i think, take 3 things mash them together and see what you get. The story is very linear progressing through various dungeons, capturing various demons as well as training them. You may revisit some dungeons as well. The length of the game is quite short if you dont get distracted by some of the things present in the game.  Presentation-----  Very nicely drawn anime characters bringing out some great assets in them as well as appealing look for everyone. The music wasnt exactly the best part of the game, but it wasnt the worse part either.   Mechanics------  The game is very easy to figure out and play honestly and the first person aspect gives it an interesting look. Its somewhat replayable, maybe run through it for the plot then go through it for all of the interesting scenes.

3766;;One of my favorite games as a young Star Wars enthusiast in the late 90s. Replaying it now, I continue to be impressed by the progression that this game represents from the already excellent TIE FIGHTER, in terms of mission variety, storytelling and integration with the Star Wars canon.  That said, this is not a game without issues. The missions are sometimes a little too complex, with poorly communicated objectives that change while youre flying. Occasionally, this can lead to costly mistakes, like, say, when you blow up the wrong ship without realizing the failure conditions had been updated, and all of the sudden you need to start the whole mission over. The structure of the game is kind of limited in this regard, with most of the pertinent information -- objectives and otherwise -- coming by way of quick, overlapping voice samples that can get lost amid your wingmens chatter. It can be a little too hard to follow sometimes. This hurts both the playability of the missions and your comprehension of the story. And thats doubly a shame, then, because the plot is usually interesting and its a shame to have to breeze through it while youre fighting for your life.  Also, though I hate to say it, this is a game that could have used some more polish, because at times its downright buggy. Missions would break more often than should be acceptable, forcing restarts, voice samples are all over the place in quality and volume, and other elements of the presentation can be shoddy or mismatched at times. Worst of all, the Battle of Endor (which remains an awesome set piece to close out the game, no matter what) is kind of clumsy in its execution and could have used some more thought. Cool though it may be, it feels like it was jammed in at the last minute.  Like I said, this game has a ton of nostalgic value for me, and its a treat to play it again (especially because -- for reasons that remain totally inexplicable -- no company on the planet will make this type of game anymore, let alone in the Star Wars universe). But that doesnt mean I can ignore the games flaws, especially when some are so glaring.;169;;- Can be really buggy - Generally a bit unpolished - Endor, as cool as it is, could have been even better;;- The last great Star Wars space sim - Great storyline that combines a smaller-scale family drama with the larger intergalactic war we know and love - A wide variety of scenarios and ships to encounter;Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance;53165;315587
3767;;(This review is mostly going to focus on the gameplay and common criticisms Ive heard about or around the gameplay. Most of my story criticisms will be in the Positives/Negatives section.)  Detroit Become Human is solid narrative game with a poor narrative.  Detroit Become Human is what all story-focused games should aspire to be like, but not for the story, its the gameplay that stands out to me. Games like The Last of Us, God of War 4, The Tomb Raider reboots, Bioshock Infinite, etc. are all praised for their stories, and fair enough, but they dont come anywhere close to Detroit in terms of embracing their medium. Barely anything you do in the actual gameplay of those games actually effects the narrative or plot AT ALL, whereas Detroit will straight up cut the story in half if you fail too much. The game doesnt hold your hand, and isnt afraid to kick your ass if you mess up, and it was so refreshing as someone who has never really been impressed with the aforementioned games, or other similar titles.  Many people will dismiss this game solely on the failings of its story (dont get me wrong  the story is a mess) and others will outright dismiss it entirely by accusing it of just being a movie with a game cramped inside of it, but ultimately Detroit is a lot more cohesive as a gameplay experience than all of the above mentioned narrative games. Almost all of your interactions actually MATTER and effect the outcome of the story, and the core gameplay isnt based around tired gameplay tropes like cover-based shooting or button-mashing melee combat. (Dont get me wrong, Im not trying to say combat is what ruins those games or anything  the point is that the gameplay and the story are often always disconnected, and combat is the most common way this happens.)  Theres definitely plenty to enjoy here as far as unique gameplay experiences go, and its worth trying if youve never played a game like it before  its just unfortunate that the writing and story arent quite up to par with the rest of the gameplay.;14362;;- I felt like not all characters stories were equal in terms of impact. I found myself getting bored whenever Markus story came on, and Karas story has barely anything to do with the main plot. - The morality in this game feels very one sided at times. Humans are mostly portrayed as terrible people, whereas Androids will almost never do anything wrong. I feel like the game needed a human character to play as to even it out. - Really questionable historical imagery. You can find countless videos and articles online pointing the historical stuff out, and Im not really into history so I wont try and sound like I know what Im talking about  but what Ill say is the fact that even someone like me (who isnt an american either) noticed it should speak to how un-subtle it is. - Very dumb triggers for certain story beats. I replayed one section of the game out of curiosity for what would happen if i chose another option, and I found it pretty unbelievable how blatantly a single choice changed a pretty huge thing. There is a scene where a character becomes disillusioned with you, and threatens to kill you  and whether or not the character youre playing lives or dies is based on how much the aggressor likes you rather than anything youve actually done. It honestly made me hate that character in retrospect.;;+ Highly interactive with many ways to influence the story. The flow chart system is especially good, as youre constantly reminded of the fact that your choices are having an impact without ever spoiling anything outright.  + Good controls, a lot of reliance on quick time events but theyre usually fairly reasonable with some room to fail a bit without instantly being killed off. + Mostly good performances, there are definitely some questionable ones though. I found Markus always sounded off from the way I wanted to portray him as. + Highly polished visuals and presentation. It isnt the best looking game on PS4 but it definitely gets a lot of mileage out of the system through good scene direction and lighting. + Some effective moral choices.

Странно то, что вышедшее в 2012 году переиздание этой игры Sniper Elite v2, такой цензуре не подверглось.

После выхода Far Cry разработчики решили попробовать сделать и выпустить игру. Именно так и появился Crysis. Ну об этом потом, сейчас мы говорим про Far Cry. Я уже говорил, что изменился сеттинг.

Помните тех надоедливых военных в оригинальной игре? Именно за одного из них мы и играем. Ближе к середине игры мы начинаем понимать, что в опасности не только ученые и охранники, но даже и военные. Как и в оригинале мы встречаем тут черных оперативников. Им приказано убивать всех, даже своих (не считая остальных черных оперативников), поэтому военные попадают под удар тоже.

3788;;Одна из самых плохих игр про зомби. Сейчас я все объясню. Нам заявляют, что в игре присутствует нелинейность. Но к концу игры эта нелинейность растворяется. Мы можем на протяжении всей игры помогать выжившим, забирать их с собой, но в финале все они просто куда-то пропадут и все... Если в этой игре стрельба еще нормальная, то схватки с ходячими находятся на уровне плинтуса. Камера постоянно поворачивается в сторону противника. Я конечно все понимаю, что на других платформах это помогает, так как такого удобства, как на ПК нет нигде, но зачем же это пихать в ПК версию. Сюжет тут тоже не блистает. Всю игру мы будем ехать к зоне эвакуации, собирать выживших, лут, бензин для машины, и в конце игры Дэрил (наш персонаж) легко и просто откажется садится в вертолет. И все лишь потому, что его старший брат не хотел этого, якобы пилот был укушен. Но все фанаты Ходячих Мертвецов знаю, что для превращения нужно много времени, это конечно зависит от силы иммунитета, но все же, как будто этот пилот превратится во время полета, что за бред.;1831;;1.

3789;;Одна из самых лучших игр про зомби. Если другие игры круты своей механикой, или же своим экшеном, то эта игра берет количеством. На экране могли уместить сотни зомби. Убивать их можно чем угодно, начиная от горшков для цветов, заканчивая пулеметом. Сюжет в игре на высоте. Мы играем за Фрэнка Уэста (этот персонаж так сильно понравился аудитории, что появился еще в нескольких частях серии) он журналист, который гонится за сенсацией. И ему это удается, он находит сенсацию, зомби. Так как все выходы из города заблокированы военными Фрэнк прилетает в  городок Уильяметт (тут разворачиваются действия игры) на вертолете. Так как ему нужно оттуда выбраться он договаривается с пилотом, чтобы тот вернулся за Фрэнком через 3 дня. Все выжившие спрятались в торговом центре, поэтому всю игру мы будем именно в нем. Игра предусматривает спасение выживших, но это не влияет на концовку игры, кстати их несколько. Пока Фрэнк находится в торговом центре ему предстоит узнать, что же тут произошло и почему появились зомби, и ему это удается. После чего он покидает Уильяметт, но не все так просто. Я очень много сократил, в эти 3 дня происходит очень много вещей, но я не хочу спойлерить вам это, лучше сыграйте в игру сами, она того стоит.;4797;;1.

3790;;In case you have never played it before, Celeste is a game about a girl who seems to be going through tough times, and she is trying to cope with them by climbing Celeste mountain. It is a 2D platformer with extremely difficult challenges and many cool mechanics. The goal of the game is to reach the top of the mountain, but it becomes more than that once you are deeper into the game and also in the postgame. The gameplay in Celeste is outstanding. Everything works so well. There are no bugs that I have come across, and the controls are great. Moving around in the game doesn’t feel stiff at all. The move set of climbing walls and dashing with Y is a fun change to keep the game interesting and different from all of the other 2D platformers. It all flows at a slower pace than Super Meatboy, so it is easy to digest, but there are some sections that get crazy and you have to act fast. The level design is absolutely fantastic. Some of the levels in this game really play around with physics, and that is fun to see and figure out. Every level feels unique because they introduce brand new mechanics each time. Each level sticks with that mechanic, and there isn’t a lot of overlap in other levels except for the dash mechanic. All of the levels are memorable because they all look super different. The art direction in this game is absolutely amazing. I wish I could make pixelated environments that looked even 1% as good. Every environment has its own visual flare that helps immerse you in this 2D setting. The difficulty level in this game is insane. This might turn some people off, but I still love this game, even if I get frustrated sometimes. The hotel level and the final two levels in particular gave me epic gamer moments. This game has one of the hardest final boss fights ever. The post game content is even crazier. I literally can’t get past the 3rd or 4th screen because the post game levels are just that insane. Something else insane about this game is the original score. I love this soundtrack  particularly tracks 2, 3, and the track for the final main level. This soundtrack is masterfully crafted. It is a perfect modern take on an 8-bit soundtrack. God of War, Life Is Strange 2, and Assassins Creed Odyssey have some amazing soundtracks, but Celeste might take the cake for the best 2018 soundtrack. That is really hard to decide though since Celeste and Life Is Strange 2 are very close. Really the only bad thing I can say about it is that it feels short. Beating the game took me less than 8 hours. The rest of the problems I have are very nitpicky and don’t effect the score much. Overall, Celeste is a ridiculously fun game with extremely hard difficulty, excellent level design, and a killer soundtrack. I totally recommend Celeste to the most hardcore of epic gamers. Final score: 96;26226;;;;-brilliant level design -great controls -great story -visually stunning -perfect difficulty level -one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever;Celeste: The Greatest 2D platformer I’ve ever played;54068;315914
3791;;The game features a port of the original Gearbox PC port of Halo CE to the Xbox 360, with the ability to switch between the original games graphics and all-new remade graphics mode with only a second or two of loading time.

3792;;When the game released it was a fun little surprise. The game has a large variety of weapons to use in a variety of stages with multiple hidden paths and challenges that are complemented by the use of the tanks momentum and geomodding, such as blowing up walls, pillars, or even blowing a hole in the ground and using that hole as a ramp to reach new paths or hidden weapons.;117276;;Not much story;;Fun gameplay;c;54146;316245
3793;as far as a standalone goes, very solid. It differs itself enough from the base game that it is totally worth playing. If you enjoyed New Order then its a no brainer. Maybe a tad repetitive, but clocking at about 6hrs makes it a sweet spot. Recommended!;Just like the base game Old Blood is a high quality single player narrative, its does a good job at that. no nonsense multiplayer, loot boxes and what not +1  Not a ton of innovation from New Order, i do like the Pipe though which is a pretty iconic weapon and the added climbing mechanic was pretty neat.   I somehow didnt expect it to turn that dramatic on the occult and fantasy scale, but im not too familiar with Wolfenstein as a series so maybe it was expected? Having random zombies, tombs and monsters is pretty much but i somehow preferred the straight up dystopian alternate reality of the base game.;9192;;weapons werent particularly memorable Underwhelming end boss;6;The Occult!

3794;;Шедевр. Эта игра перевернула игровую индустрию, и вдохновила многих людей к творчеству. Она вышла в 1998 году, а различного рода модификации, со своим сюжетом, выходят и по сей день. В игре присутствует множество загадок, которые до сих пор не разгаданы, и будут разгаданы еще не скоро. Практически каждый геймер ждет продолжения, но надежда со временем гаснет. Надеюсь история Гордона Фримена не закончится на событиях Half-Life 2: Episode Two. В этой серии игр отлично проработанный сюжет, который переплетается между всеми частями игры.Так, мы можем увидеть во второй части игры Барни, охранника, того самого, который в еще в первой части открыл дверь Гордону. Выпустив эту игру компания Valve стала очень знаменитой, и возможно самой богатой. В игре есть необычная особенность. В ней нет кат-сцен. Мы от начала и до конца все видим глазами героя.

3796;;Эта игра уже стала классикой. Я не могу представить себе такой жанр, как шутер, без Call Of Duty. Первые части игры были про Вторую Мировую Войну. Позже от этой идеи решили отказаться, но не навсегда. В игре всего есть 3 кампании: Американская, Британская и за Советский Союз. Самым насыщенным является последний, по моему мнению.

3797;;While it was a big deal at the time, this one definitely shows its age today. The core gameplay is much more hardcore than its sequels, with cheating keeping you from progressing through the plot and permadeath(!) for your pilot if youre not careful to eject (or if youre unlucky enough to get scooped up by the Empire afterwards). Also, you really have to babysit the energy expenditures of your engines, shields, and weapons in every mission, leading to situations where you run out of firepower or find yourself fumbling with the levels at a crucial moment. While these mechanics do keep the player immersed and involved, Im glad they were de-emphasized in later entries.  I will say that something this game has over its descendants is its immediate presentation. You can feel the love that went into the design of this games sprite graphics, cinematics, and especially the network of Rebel Alliance ships that represents the games menus. These aspects of the game definitely got all the care befitting the first true Star Wars space combat game, and its still exhilarating to feel like youre really joining up and taking it to the Empire.  An important landmark and a good foundation for things to come, but not terribly accessible or fun to play in 2019.

3798;;I really felt like this could have an amazing story that ended up being incredibly linear and not very well explored.

3801;;Looks like Jupiter kind of bunted with this first Nintendo Switch outing of their Picross series. The presentation is nice, it plays perfectly fine on the new system, but theres absolutely nothing new here besides 2-player, and its actually missing a bunch of modes and featuers from the recent 3DS games, which doesnt make much sense.   Youve got your regular Picross and your Mega Picross and thats it ... but I beat all the former to find out that the Mega Picrosses are just the same pictures as before, only Megad up! Pretty sure theyve never pulled that in the previous games? I know the picture is barely the point, but ... come on. Do some new pictures. Feels cheap.  Im sure the next ones are more fully featured, but yeah, it doesnt feel great going from the latest PICROSS E games to this one.

3840;;Breath of the Wild is one of the few games that have changed me. It is a game so immersive that I get absolutely mesmerized by everything it has to offer. Breath of the Wild is the only game that I have logged in 160+ hours. The closest another game has gotten is Assassins Creed: Origins at 83 hours. Breath of the Wild is the game that I had the most hype for ever in my life. It was on my mind nonstop after I first learned about it in 2015. It is crazy to think that the first footage of the game ever shown was nearly 5 years ago at the Game Awards in 2014. That showcase of Zelda U is perhaps the greatest gameplay reveal  in human history.  E3 2016 Day 1 was an absolutely crazy day. This is the day that truly pushed me even further into hype mode, and this is the day that my life changed forever. This game totally deserved all of the hype, but I hyped myself with the story a tad bit too much. The story of Breath of the Wild is kind of underwhelming and not what I was expecting. Because the marketing showed some of the memories, I was led to believe that this would be a story driven game with time travel involved. I was so wrong. Now, I love the story that we got, and the structure that the story was told, but I was expecting something else, and that threw me off. The story of the game is essentially waking up, recovering memories, freeing the divine beasts, and stopping Calamity Ganon. Thankfully however, the memories you recover are rich in lore and are fun to watch. Overall on the story aspect, I love this game’s story, but there is definitely room in the sequel to add more to it. The boss is very cool, but then you get to that damn pig. That is sort of underwhelming, but it is such a small section of the game that it is practically a nitpick. This game is so big and has so much stuff that all of the problems I have with this game really don’t effect the score much at all. The art design is phenomenal. This is easily the most beautiful looking Zelda game and one of the best looking games ever. The game world in this game is absolutely breathtaking. I’ve had this game for 2 and a half years and I still haven’t explored every single detail. The emptiness doesn’t bother me much at all, because I get lost in it so easily. All of the environments feel so unique. All of my favorite sections of the map are the new ones and/or the massively overhauled ones like Hebra, Faron, and Akkala. I love all of the lore included in the game world too. There is so much included with the landscapes that it is requiring a sequel to clarify it (with all of the Zonai stuff of course). This game world is easily the best ever created. It sucks me in so easily. The gameplay is amazing. Finally Nintendo added a jump button, and the climbing is so fun to do. I don’t really have a problem with the rain interrupting climbing, but it does happen stupidly often. The combat is fantastic. However, weapons break way too quickly. The swimming is a little annoying but not much. The enemies have enough variety to keep me interested, but more would be nice. The cooking/crafting mechanics do need upgrades, but since this was so new to Zelda I’m fine with what we got. There are some amazing music pieces in this movie, but as a whole the soundtrack underwhelms a little. It would have been great if Nintendo granted a soundtrack player like they did in Super Mario Odyssey. The side quests in this game are nice and diverse, but the next Zelda game needs more side quests than this one. I personally love the divine beasts. They are a quite nice departure from the traditional dungeons. However, I can’t wait for traditional dungeons to return in some fashion in the next game. The one nitpick I have with the dungeons is that there are 40 blessings shrines. That is way too many lazily done shrines. Overall, what we got was near perfect. As a first time for Zelda, I am willing to forgive many of the disappointing things in this game. There is a ton of stuff that the sequel can improve on. Breath of the Wild may not be worthy of a full 100, but I am confident in Nintendo that they will make the sequel worthy of a 100. This review doesn’t sound like a near perfect review, but the experience is so amazing that I can’t justify giving the game any less. Breath of the Wild is easily my favorite game ever.

3874;;Metroid is the first platformer that Ive ever played to completion. Prior to playing it, I had thought that I would probably never really like any platformers. When I actually played Metroid, I was honestly pretty hooked.   I thought the control felt incredibly smooth (and kind of magical in a strange way) and the gameplay was difficult but (usually) forgiving, given that you would eventually learn how to best combat enemies. There were unfortunately a decent chunk of enemies that felt kind of unfair, but I could tell that if I wasnt so inexperienced at platformers, that they wouldnt have been all that bad.  There definitely were some obvious technical limitations, which kind of put a hamper on the gameplay, with one example being how sometimes enemies wouldnt spawn until their spawn location was already on the screen (and not just at the edge, I mean like a sixth of the way onto the screen). While in most games, stuff like this would just go to frustrate me, there was something about Metroid that made me kind of not care too much about it. Maybe I was just forgiving it since I knew it was treading on undiscovered territory in video games, and that it was made for the NES. I dont know.  Either way, I think Metroid actually proved to be a pretty great game even with its flaws considered.;1101;;Boss design Platforming (specifically with the Screw Attack) Very obvious technical limitations;18;Controls (Most of the time) Art Skill/Upgrade progression;Brendos Metroid Review;54819;319050

3877;Overall, I thought that Ni No Kuni was a fun time, and Im glad that I checked it out.;Before I get into this review, I would like to say who I might recommend this game to. I think that fans of anime (especially fans of Ghibli Studios) would absolutely adore this game. Aside from that, pretty much anyone who likes games such Pokemon and Final Fantasy would find this game to be a good time. Anyways...  GAMEPLAY: Boy, oh boy was I not expecting what I ended up getting. The main battle system revolves around capturing familiars (similar to Pokemon) and then using them to battle using a battle system that is a pretty unique active battle system with some turn-based qualities like cooldowns. I thought that this system was incredibly cool, although it admittedly doesnt really shine that brightly when in normal combat because most of the time, it seemed just spamming X as quickly as possible to keep on doing normal attacks was pretty much the best option to win. But when it came to the bosses, the battle system really starts to flex its beautiful pecs. As any good boss does, the bosses in Ni No Kuni force you to think on your feet and pay attention on how the rest of your team is doing. But before you get to the boss fight, you gotta make sure you got your familars. And theres a lot of them, and theyre pretty varied. The familiar system as a whole is pretty deep, and there is a lot to do to min/max your familiars. I didnt really care to try doing too much of it though, so I wont speak too much on it. Unfortunately, there are a lot of familiars that just kind of... suck. Like really bad. I can understand wanting to implement a few familiars that are stronger than others, sure, but there are quite a few familiar that make me go Why would I ever want these? Theyre actually just garbage. So now that you have to kind of set aside a bunch of familiars, of course you would want to go and get some of the really good ones, no? Of course you would. Trouble is, they can be pretty frustrating to capture. Serenading familiars is completely random, and most familiars have a really low capture rate, alongside a rather low spawn rate. Familiars also have these things called Tricks which are basically just spells, and they also kind of suck. I mean, some are broken af, but most are just slot fillers that youll never use.  ARTWORK: Oh my lord the artwork is BEAUTIFUL. I cant really say much other than just look at a screenshot and youll instantly understand. I love me some cel-shading, and this game does it incredibly well.  *Warning: Potential Spoiler beyond*  PLOT: There isnt really much to write home about on this one. The story is basically just a story youd see in something like a Studio Ghibli film. This story will evoke the same feeling that a something like Spirited Away. Its a bit basic but heartwarming. Thankfully, the game marches along at a good pace, although I feel as though it is a bit too long. I feel like the game wouldve benefited from cutting out the whole Oh, you thought it was over? Well, it isnt, heres some more part. although with the way the story was written, it was kind of necessary to exist. (By the way, I TOTALLY saw the surprise coming, there were so many loose ends).  CHARACTERS: The same things that applied to the overall plot apply to the characters as well. Theyre pretty archetypal, but never to the games detriment. I loved Drippy though, hearing the Lord High Lord of the Fairies speak with a Scottish accent led to some fantastic times.;1864;Ever since I saw Rob from Playstation Access gushing over the Ni No Kuni series, Ive always been intrigued by what kind of game this could possibly be. I never really looked into just what kind of game it was, so I really had no idea about what the game would be other than Its like Anime: The Video Game and that it was probably some sort of JPRG similar to Final Fantasy. And although I didnt really know too much, I was still very much looking forward to seeing what kind of game it was. So braving myself, I dove head first into this game, clueless as to just what I was getting myself into.;Familars are unbalanced Familiar tricks suck Too long;9;Unique battle system BEAUTIFUL artwork Good pacing Charming story and characters;Brendos Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Review;54819;319053

It didnt have nearly as many awesome features as Brawl has. First of all, the obvious. More characters. Now that doesnt make a game better, but it is just a bit extra.

3885;;Вторая часть серии игр Far Cry, на мой взгляд самая ужасная. Давайте по порядку. В начале игры нам дают выбрать персонажа, к сожалению, это не влияет на игру, все они довольно похожи друг на друга. Мы прибываем в страну Африки с целью убить торговца оружием - Шакала. Его заказали, потому что он продавал оружие двум воюющим сторонам. Обе эти стороны (ОФОТ и СНС) борются за власть в стране, где происходит действие игры. Нам предстоит работать на обе эти группировки, чтобы получить информацию о Шакале. Вскоре после прибывания в страну мы заражаемся малярией, теперь, примерно, каждые 2 игровых дня нам надо пить лекарство, которое надо пополнять. Все миссии в игре однообразны, независимо на какую сторону мы работаем. Мы должны будем либо что-то взорвать, либо кого-то убить. Именно так выглядит структура каждого задания. Спойлерить не буду, поэтому расскажу про финал игры вкратце. Он слит. Что-бы мы не делали он всегда один и тот же. Он просто ужасен.

The result is that you dont feel much like a badass superhero, but instead some under-prepared schmuck faced with gauntlet after great-looking gauntlet that would make Mega Man shake in his little blue boots.

3889;;It took me a while, but I am happy to say that I have accepted this as a worthy YAKUZA spinoff.   I wont lie -- initially, JUDGMENT didnt impress me too much. While all the minigames and fun side quests weve come to expect from any given RGG Studios game are present and accounted for, the core gameplay loop has been altered to fit this games new direction.   Theres less of a focus on combat (at least at first) and what there is of it is worse than usual. The new player character, Yagami, is physically weaker than YAKUZA protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. This both makes sense contextually (Yagami isnt quite the legendary superhero Kiryu is, and his story is at least slightly more grounded) and forces you to approach the fights from a different perspective. Honestly, it feels fresh to be more fragile. But in the end, it just makes things slightly more difficult, and at least for me, challenging combat is not why I play these games. Especially irritating is the new Mortal Wound mechanic, where especially vicious attacks semi-permanently break off a whole chunk of your lifebar, requiring you to use rare items or pay a certain NPC to restore it. The attacks are usually very well telegraphed, and designed to be easy-ish to avoid, but its still not a particularly good idea, just adding frustration to the fighting instead of tension.   Gameplay-wise, the usual YAKUZA brawling is downplayed to make room for Yagamis day job, being private eye. Detective work, courtroom drama, and the law are the focus of the plot, and as such, much of your time is spent engaging in investigation with much-touted new gameplay elements such as tracking, observing, chasing, and even some honest-to-God Phoenix Wright-style evidence presenting. Unfortunately, none of these new activities feel like anything more than minigames, and by the tenth time youre tailing a suspect as they slowly wander around the Kamurocho, rushing to hide behind something when they predictably turn around, youre going to wish you had YAKUZAs full focus on ass-kicking back. The searching and chasing are even worse, with the former being a sub-visual novel Wheres Waldo diversion in an engine clearly not suited to it, and the latter essentially being classic SHENMUE Quick-Time Events that weve actually seen in YAKUZA games going back years.  But these gripes aside, I still ended up liking this game quite a bit. For one thing -- and this should probably go without saying -- it IS a YAKUZA game, which means it is fun and funny and good, period. Nobody should be surprised by this. If youve played any of these since YAKUZA 0, you know what youre getting, and that it will be professionally-made and effortlessly entertaining on many levels. But JUDGMENT manages to surpass some of its more recent predecessors in one area -- the main story.   Later games in the YAKUZA series have faced the challenge of just what to do with their long-established characters and settings by embracing episodic, twist-focused stories that end up not having a ton of impact when all is said and done. Theyre diverting, sure, but many times they just seem like some other peoples convoluted stories that Kiryu is walking into, despite the series long history. JUDGMENT establishes a new, distinct lead and surrounds him with supporting character dynamics that dont necessarily resemble anything from the other franchise, and the story -- despite being about a murder mystery and starring a private investigator -- is actually refreshingly straightforward and grounded. It has twists, but theyre manageable, and the through line of the villainous plot is much more legible than your average Japanese crime story.  There were times when JUDGMENT bored me (it notably sags right after the beginning chapters) and when I asked myself what the point of spinning off the YAKUZA series in this particular direction was. But in the end, Yagami and his approach to the tried-and-true formula charmed me, and the plot came through in a very satisfying way. By the end, the game had justified itself, and at this point, to me, any continuation would be very welcome.  (beat the story mode on normal difficulty, completed around 90% of all side content);109274;;- The fighting is weaker and tougher than usual - I miss Kiryu;;- Its YAKUZA, and YAKUZA rules - Yagami and his friends are fresh characters in this world - The difference in tone and perspective works as intended, and is reflected in gameplay - The main plot might be better than a couple of the lesser mainline games;c;53165;320116

3892;So what did I think? Well, I mean, I intentionally chose to stop playing the game before finishing it. Thats all that really needs to be said.;Im going to preface this by saying that I did not finish this game. I got pretty close though  I got to the third stage of the Sigma Fortress before deciding that I did not want to waste any more time playing a game that I knew I wasnt really enjoying.  GAMEPLAY: Oh boy, where do I start. The game is formulaic. Everybody who knows about the Mega Man games should know that. You got eight stages that lead up to a boss fight. After you beat those bosses, you go onto a final area where you fight all the bosses again as you make your way to the final boss. The stages in this game (and I assume in every other Mega Man game) feel like theyre just there to extend game length. The stages dont matter, the boss fights are the only part of the game that the developers really seemed to care about. The stages were like decently designed I guess, but I can tell that not too much thought got put into them. So what about the bosses? Theyre way too difficult without the weapon advantages, and way too easy with the weapon advantages. A few of the bosses seemed like they were actually really well designed but as soon as I stepped in with their weakness it just didnt matter. Maybe the final boss was some really cool fight but I honestly dont care, and I dont think it wouldve swayed my mind enough to make me think any differently about all the other bosses. The controls as a whole felt fine, although trying to charge up my weapon while also trying to dodge around way so difficult for me. Im sure that if I were better at the game, it would be easier to do, but I feel as though the control scheme played a part in it. Other than that, platforming was pretty decent, except when enemies would suddenly spawn above the platform you were jumping to as you were jumping to it, which happened WAY too often, and it proved to be extremely frustrating.  STORY AND CHARACTERS: There isnt much to discuss here. What little amount of story and characters there are is super basic. Nothing interesting to be found here.;1741;So, I decided to try out the Mega Man series after I played and enjoyed the original Metroid. Seeing as I was (and still am) pretty trash at platformers, I figured I should start with the Mega Man X games instead of the brutally unforgiving original games.

Мы можем подхватить плохую мутацию, которая будет мешать нам в прохождении. Давайте поговорим о ее плюсах и минусах. В игре есть 9 концовок, но в меню информации их указанно всего 8, именно столько я и получил, как получить 9-ую я не знаю, возможно это ошибка, ведь игра только вышла, а может я что-то упустил (за 8 прохождений упустил, да). Главным минусом как раз и являются эти концовки. После получения первой мы получаем нового персонажа и нам предстоит пройти то же самое испытание, и так всего 8 раз.

3895;So thats about it. I didnt care for this game that much, due in very large part to my issues with the gameplay. With that being said, I am still very excited to play Uncharted 2, because Im sure that theyll fix a lot of my issues with this game.;GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of this game is where like 99% of my issues lie. To put it simply, Uncharted 1s gameplay is horribly unbalanced. There are way too many gunfights and not nearly enough exploration. Maybe the balance that this game does have could be forgivable if the gunfights were enjoyable, but in my opinion, they are just really bad in practically every single way. The guns dont feel great (due in part to the PS3 controllers analog sticks). The gunfights themselves hold absolutely no weight, as it feels like they are just thrown at you for absolutely no reason at all. Oh? You just made it into some random part of a jungle with nothing in it? Gunfight. You just made it through some abandoned ship? Gunfight. You just made your way into a hidden crypt that was supposed to be a secret only discoverable through some old puzzle that Francis Drake set up? Enemies are already there. G-u-n-f-i-g-h-t. That last point brings up another point. Enemies are often just in places where they shouldnt be. Like in that crypt, or in some cave you have to squeeze your way into. Why are they here? How did they get here? Why didnt they already discover stuff? I dont know, but I do know they want to get into a gunfight with you. And unfortunately for you, there isnt just a few enemies in each gunfight, there are wave after wave after wave of nameless meatbags with guns running at you. It just feels so pointless and just straight up annoying. And then there are the jet-ski portions of the game. They couldve been a super cool fast paced moments but instead you are given the task of simultaneously driving as Nathan through barrel ridden waters AND shooting at the ridiculous enemies as Elena. And the only reasonable way to get past all the stupid barrels is to slow down as Nate so that you can shoot the absurd amount of barrels as Elena. In doing so, you lose all potential of having a fast-paced cinematic moments. The exploration parts are fun when they are around but the gunfights so oppressive that its hard to take them in. You know youve messed up as developers when your player spends all his time exploring dreading the next gunfight.  MUSIC &amp  SOUND: I honestly dont remember the music or anything. Im pretty sure it was fitting given the type of game this is, but it sure didnt stand out to me that much.  VISUALS: This game actually looked pretty good, even given that it is a bit dated. That being said, the setting wasnt anything special. Just like a generic deserted tropical island with some old building. As such, the scenery itself didnt feel very special, if that makes sense. The scenery wasnt special but it still was pleasant to look at.  *SPOILER FREE*  STORY: I can tell that Naughty Dog took HEAVY inspiration from Indiana Jones, and Ive only seen one Indiana Jones movie. The plot just sounds like an Indiana Jones movie.  CHARACTERS: Okay, now here is where the game finally does something INCREDIBLY well. The main characters are amazing. I love Nate, I love Elena, I love Sully. They are all hilarious. I have nothing but praise for them, theyre done right in every way possible. Nate is easily one of the most charismatic characters in any piece of media that I have ever consumed. Elena is super lovable and she perfectly compliments Nate. Sully is the uncle Ive always wish I had. The bad guys were kind of generic, but thats very forgivable given just how awesome the main cast is.;431;The first time I had ever played an Uncharted game was soon after I had bought my PS4, when I borrowed my friends copy of Uncharted 4. I loved it, it was a great mixture of well-written characters and super fun exploration/gunfighting gameplay. A little later down the line, I had signed up for a free trial of Playstation Now and saw that the first (and I think the second and third ones too). Of course I immediately booted it up. And what did I think? I thought it sucked! I hated it! It was easily my least favorite game I had ever played (up to that point). Like 3 years later, I finally bought a PS3 and decided it was as good a time as ever to give the game another shot. Spoilers: My opinion havent changed all that much.;Way too many gunfights Gunfights are bad in every conceivable way Not nearly enough exploration Many cinematic moments are ruined by bad gameplay Pretty generic story;9;Amazing characters;Brendos Uncharted: Drakes Fortune Review;54819;319052
3896;;А потянет ли она Crysis ? Именно таким вопросом в двухтысячных задавались геймеры, покупая новую видеокарту. Несмотря на дату выпуска игры, графика в ней выглядит лучше, чем в тех играх, которые выходят в наши дни. Помню как у меня в детстве был диск с различными модификациями на эту игру и у меня не получилось в те года пройти ни основную игру, ни модификацию, но вот, пришло время и я прошел эту замечательную игру. Разработчик действительно постарался. Так на ограниченном пространстве, геймер не чувствует себя как в кишке. У нас есть куча возможностей, а все это благодаря костюму главного героя. Мы можем переключаться между режимами костюма и исходя из этого создать свою собственную тактику боя с корейцами и пришельцами. Арсенал тут конечно не велик, но и игра не особо длительна, так что того, что есть в игре хватает. В игре был предусмотрен реализм. Так на низких уровнях сложности все довольно стандартно и не имеет логики. Патроны подбираются волшебным образом, то есть сами, а корейцы почему-то говорят на английском, но стоит поставить сложность повыше и уже придется подбирать патроны самому, а корейцы начнут говорить на своем родном языке. В центре сюжета спецназ, которому было поручено разузнать что случилось с учеными, которые подали сигнал бедствия. К нашему несчастью сигнал был подан на вражеской территории, поэтому мы начинаем перестреливаться с корейцами - нашими противниками. Наш спецотряд имеет костюм, очень мощный. У этого костюма есть несколько режимов : броня, маскировка, скорость и сила. Переключаясь между этими режимами мы получаем преимущество над врагом. Позже мы узнаем, что ученые обнаружили сильный источник энергии, после этот источник, а точнее то, что из него вылазило начало убивать наших напарников. Это были пришельцы. Позже мы и вовсе попали прямо в источник всей этой энергии и благополучно из него выбрались. Правительство узнает о происходящем на острове и решает сбросить бомбы на остров, где происходит действие игры, но как мы знаем, взрыв - это энергия, а этот излучатель энергии на острове может поглотить этот взрыв и стать только сильнее, что и случается. Мы забираем остатки от нашей команды, выжившую ученую и сваливаем с острова попутно отстреливая пришельцев. В общем это был такой сильно урезанный сюжет Crysis. Также у игры есть самостоятельное дополнение - Crysis Warhead. В этом дополнении главным героем выступает другой боец, все из того же спецотряда - Псих. Действия игры происходят в то же время, что и основная игра. Продолжение мы увидим во второй части игры, которую я пока что не прошел, но это будет в ближайшем будущем.;296;;-;6;1. Графика. 2.

3897;;A great effort in the Platinum Games pantheon of shoot-slash-dodge action games. Whats even better was the dedication to recreating the look and feel of the original 80s cartoon. It truly was a nostalgic trip to see all the original designs lovingly rendered and to still hear the likes of Peter Cullen and Frank Welker still locked in eternal Autobot/Decepticon battle.   There were some elements that felt like unnecessary depth added to the game like the leveling up and synthesizing of weapons, but its appreciated for those that might want to sink in more time and try their hand at harder difficulties when doing so, although the normal difficulty was plenty challenging for me especially when it got really hectic on-screen with multiple enemies. Still, the base game felt fun enough to play and it adds to my respect of Platinum Games.;11175;;;;;c;29411;320421
3898;;This SNES brawler showcases a truly impressive level of fidelity to the film its based on, but in the end thats both a strength and a weakness. The look is especially faithful, with each and every enemy and location ripped directly from the movie. Unfortunately, though, this means that everything looks a little too realistic, and, due to the plot of the film, most of the enemies are boring clowns. When I play a side-scrolling brawler, Im looking for a ton of fun, colorful levels and enemies. I keep going because Im excited to see what crazy stuff is in the next level, what outlandish boss is waiting for me at the end of the scroll. This is whats most fun to me about this type of game, and in this instance, its limited by being such a close adaptation of an existing work.  The moment to moment combat feels pretty good, and does an especially good job of making the player feel like the unstoppable badass that Batman is supposed to be. You stomp around levels stoically, tossing thugs aside by the nape of their neck and even knocking their heads together if you get one on either side of you. This is an area where the adherence to the film really works -- Tim Burtons tone and his take on Batman fits this gameplay perfectly.   When the gameplay switches to pure side-scrolling or driving, though, it fares much worse. The 2D platforming levels just flat out dont work. The characters big sprites and the lack of depth make everything feel cramped and the batarang-based combat is clumsy and doesnt fit with the rest of the game. The SNES-obligitory mode 7 driving stage is even worse, but its blessedly brief and easy.  Overall, this game is a weird kind of a achievement worth appreciating for its verisimilitude, even if its not the most fun thing in the world to play.;121242;;- The non-brawler stages suck - The stages and enemies end up being kind of boring because theyre limited to whats in the film;;- A stunningly close adaptation of the film Batman Returns - Batman feels like Batman in this one -- a grim ass-kicker;c;53165;320424
3899;;Very charming artwork and a moderately interesting new spin on the usual Picross action.   Most puzzles are also battles with RPG-style monsters. That basically amounts to a soft time-limit, with either you or the enemy doing damage based on how much of the puzzle you are or arent doing. There are also usable items that you can buy or earn that keep the enemy from hitting you, refill your health, or help you with the puzzle in limited ways. Thats it! But how much more do you need? Youll be charmed by the cute artwork and animations of the completed puzzles.  Got me to think at least a little differently about how I approached Picross, and engaged me through a full set of challenges. Cant ask for much more from the hundredth one of these weve seen.;121615;;- Didnt love the music - Could be a touch more ambitious;;- Adds some minor new spins on the old Picross gameplay - Excellent artwork;c;53165;320425
3900;;A serviceable but dull platformer. The only highlight is the outstanding soundtrack, which, even given Sunsofts high standards, is really impressive.;10510;;- Just kind of blah all-around;;- That soundtrack;c;53165;320439
3901;;Cut-rate Final Fight with way less personality. Yeah, its got some good music, and a couple nice touches (the outdoor elevator level ascending the side of a skyscraper, your super attack is a cop buddy rolling up in his squad car and blasting the area with a Stinger missile), but thats about it. The characters are much too small and the levels to wide for a brawler like this, especially one where everyone walks so slowly. The series will see a lot of refinement from here, but this is still a weak starting point.;1652;;- The gameplay is just off - Bosses are exceptionally annoying;29;- Cool little touches here and there;c;53165;320440
3902;;Definitely a big jump from its predecessor, almost bringing the series up to the level of Capcoms FINAL FIGHT. Strangely, Yuzo Koshiros celebrated music isnt quite as cool here as it was in the first game, but everything else has been improved immensely. Characters are bigger and better animated, the graphics are vibrant and much more varied (despite familiar enemies and areas) and we finally have popular genre conventions in place like enemy names and lifebars on the HUD. The combat feels very good now, too, with fun new moves and four pretty different characters to choose from. Still has room to grow, but this is a big step in the right direction.;1653;;- I dont think this soundtrack is as good as the first games - Disappointingly familiar enemies and especially final boss;;- Looks and plays much better than the last one - Feels much more like a true brawler - Four playable characters!;c;53165;320441
3903;;Carries over the goofiness from STREETS OF RAGE 2, but with more purpose this time. Theres a relatively ambitious story here, for this type of game, complete with cutscenes and plot twists and character interactions. Many of the enemies are reused from the previous title, but the new ones (especially the bosses) are very well done. Overall the art has evolved into something quite impressive, with great character portraits and especially excellent levels.   Unfortunately, the series need to one-up itself is taken a little too far in places. There is now a new super move system with upgrades and cooldowns which adds some depth but just seems unnecessarily complex in the end. Each stage seems to need a gimmick, and some are definitely better than others, making for a couple pretty unbearable levels. Additionally, the game feels much, much more difficult than its predecessors.  The soundtrack shines again, this time feeling weirder and more experimental than ever. It might be the best of the series.  Its come a long way from the first entry. Still not quite in the all-time greats of the genre, but definitely respectable.;1654;;- Really, really difficult - Some areas are irritating;;- Ambitious presentation and story for a brawler - Cool and unorthodox soundtrack, as expected - Great art all around;c;53165;320442
3904;;Beautifully aggravating. I wish there was more of it. (Yeah, thats right, I beat it.);72373;;- I could play twenty times this much of it;;- One hell of a challenge - Heady but not full of itself - Charmingly oblique art;c;53165;320443
3905;;Its not CASTLEVANIA on Genesis ... its GENESIS CASTLEVANIA.   Breaks off from the pack with a totally fresh take on the venerable CASTLEVANIA series in the way that only Konami on Genesis in the mid-90s could do. Its a wild, weird, goofy cavalcade of every creative platformer element on their minds at the time, and while not every piece of every level pays off, you just have to keep playing to see whats next.   The sound effects are little weak, but the music is some of the all-time best for the series, and probably some of the best on the Genesis as well. Theres no other entry like it in the VANIA canon, and maybe thats a good thing. But who knew that GENESIS CASTLEVANIA was what we all secretly wanted and needed?;1127;;- Not all the weird platforming elements are home runs;;- All over the place in the best possible way - Breaks from series tradition to satisfying effect - Incredibly sick soundtrack;c;53165;320444
3906;;A lot of good art, a lot of creativity in the characters and the enemies, but theres maybe just a bit too much going on for the gameplay to be as fun as it could and should be. There are tons of weapons and pickups to manage during the fast-paced shooting action, and its easy to get totally overwhelmed by enemies while youre trying to sort through all your options. This would be more manageable if the penalty for dying wasnt so severe, but it is.   The game is long (not a bad thing, especially given all the distinctive art and attention to detail everywhere) so saving up your lives and making sure you get through every level correctly is paramount. For me, this means I can never really find a groove. I want to slow down and appreciate the graphics, strategize, explore, etc., but the constantly respawning waves of enemies will keep you running for your life. Add to that some slightly slipshod collision and shooting mechanics, and theres going to be a little frustration. Play it to get a little taste of Lucasarts magic.;2162;;- Punishing - Gameplay is too frantic and exacting to appreciate everything the game has to offer;;- Looks great - Fun character design, you always want to see whats around the next corner;c;53165;320445
3907;;How much Treasure is too much Treasure? I think DYNAMITE HEADDY finds that line and steps just a little bit over it. Impossibly colorful and creative, crammed with an infinite amount of weird platforming ideas, but basically nothing has any space to breathe or develop at all. Its also punishingly difficult, which is self-defeating, because all that serves to do is keep you from seeing this staggering production that these weirdos put so much love into.  Kind of the lesser twin to GUNSTAR HEROES. Where that game had rock solid gameplay that was iterated and expanded upon in a satisfying way, this just feels more like a bunch of ideas stuck together and made way too hard to play through.;22744;;- About three times harder than it needs to be - Very little satisfying platforming;;- The art is unreal - Scads of crazy areas, characters, bosses and set pieces;c;53165;320659
3908;;A game which showcases everything your Vita can do. Certainly creative. A little easy platformer, something to do with your fingers while the TV is on.

3909;Honestly this game is one of my favorites of all time and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles or a good mystery.;GAMEPLAY: So the gameplay is pretty basic on the surface. You go around and solve puzzles as Professor Layton and Luke. While some games can kind of mess up gameplay such as this by using pretty repetitive puzzles, Professor Layton does a great job of varying the puzzles, and having a good mixture of difficult and hard puzzles. The only real nitpick I have is that the puzzles usually dont have any relation to what is going on or who the Professor and Luke are talking to. Thankfully, I know that this issue gets fixed in the next game.  MUSIC/AUDIO: The music in this game is actually pretty unique when compared to many of its contemporaries. It does a good job of conveying a mysterious feeling through it usage of instruments youd normally hear in like a jazz noir film soundtrack.  CHARACTERS: Professor Layton is such a nice gentlemen. I love him so much, personally. Hes such a fantastic role model for both the player and Luke, the other main character. Luke is still learning how to be a proper gentlemen, but it becomes clear that hes trying his best to live up to the standards set by Professor Layton. Both characters are very lovable and are fantastic main characters.  *MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*  STORY: This is honestly where a large portion of my love lies for this game. This game sets up an amazing mysterious plot and then rips it wide open with one of my favorite plot twists in any piece of media. I wish I could discuss it further but I really want to keep this review mostly spoiler free. I will say though that the setting, while mildly generic fits the situation perfectly.;1397;Ive been playing the Professor Layton since I was quite the little lad around the age of like 10. So, this series holds a pretty special place in my heart, as it was one of the first real games that I had ever played.

3910;;Вот я и прошел, наконец этот прекрасный детектив. Помню еще в 2015-2016 году, примерно, скачивал его и он весь лагал, я подумал, что дело в моём железе, но вот прошло много времени и я решил его скачать снова. С тех пор много изменилось, я улучшил компьютер по всем фронтам, но эта игра все равно лагала. Я пошел искать решение этой проблемы и узнал, что игра была портирована с консолей и поэтому был установлен лок в 30 fps. Ну я подумал и решил все же ее пройти, даже с этими 30 fps. Сюжет тут на высоте. Есть и предательство, есть и плохие копы, есть и измены, все как почти во всех детективах. Арсенал тут маленький, но оружием тут пользоваться придется не так часто, как дедукцией. Давайте поговорим о плюсах и минусах игры. Плюсы : 1. Интересный сюжет с множеством неожиданных поворотов  2. Нуарный стиль  3. Музыка  4. Возможность изучения места преступления, поиска улик и выявления преступника  5. Правильное сочетание экшена и детекива  6. Разнообразие заданий на протяжении всей игры. А теперь о минусах   1. Слитая концовка - всю игру мы раскрывали преступления и ближе к концу игры мы уже были близки к уничтожению коррупции в Лос Анджелесе, но мы пошли в канализацию спасать девку и из за чего погибли, а с коррупцией ничего не случилось, она осталась, тогда к чему то, что мы делали всю игру, в чем смысл???  2.

3913;So did I enjoy my time playing Obduction? Yes. Would I recommend it to others? Probably not. I think this game is good overall, but I dont think its special in any way that would make me want to recommend it to someone. I would rather recommend a game that is maybe weaker overall but has some really cool persistent mechanic to someone than this game.;GAMEPLAY: So Obduction is an adventure puzzle game, similar to other games like The Talos Principle and Myst (obviously). You kind of go around and just solve puzzles. Thats about all there really is to this game. Most of the puzzles are actually kind of difficult, which would be normally be fine, but I found myself getting stuck on more than one occasion. But I blame this on the fact that there are essentially no hints at all in this game. The closest youll get to a hint is one of the characters, C.W. telling you what you are generally trying to do, or a piece of paper outlining the rules of a puzzle. There is one particular puzzle that requires you to learn an entirely new number system which I thought was one of the coolest and most inventive puzzle I have ever experienced in any game ever. But aside from that, the puzzles were good but nothing special at all, a critique of which I actually extend to everything about this game.  AUDIO: The sound effects in this game are mixed so horribly. In quite a few parts of the game there was this low-humming sound effect that actually was hurting my ear to the point where I had to turn the sound effects way down just to avoid it. It wasnt like a deal-breaker or anything, it was just really annoying.  *MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*  CHARACTERS: In Obduction, you are alone aside from one other character, C.W., who is honestly a bit of a jerk. Like I would try to talk to him to get some sort of direction and he once he just kind of told me something along the lines of Id rather eat a towel than hope that youll do this right. Hes kinda mean but you dont have to interact with him much so its not a big deal. Aside from him, the only interaction youll be getting with others is through  recordings and journal entries. Nothing groundbreaking here, but I think the game executes it pretty well.  VISUALS: Obduction is a beautiful game where you explore four different worlds. One of them is the human world, and the other three are alien worlds. The human one is kind of typical fair, but its got a great variance of terrain (although the majority of it is some desert mining town). The alien worlds are also very varied from one another, and each has their own beauty to them.;8983;Obduction was a game that made its way onto my radar after it was available for free for a while on GOG. I heard that it was made by the people who made Myst, a game that I havent yet played but Ive heard was pretty good and wildly influential. So, I went into this game hoping to see what made this particular studio so good.;Basically no hints Nothing about this game is spectacular  Theres no reason to play this over a different puzzle game (aside from that one puzzle) Ear-grating sound effects;6;One particular puzzle is one of the best in any puzzle game Beautiful visuals;Brendos Obduction Review;54819;319901
3914;;Wolfenstein: Youngblood was a pretty great experience. The story was pretty interesting and had a few notable tie-ins with the other games in the franchise, the coolest one for me was the Godkey. Although there arent too many weapons in the game the gunplay is solid and the weapon customization is great. It took me around 11 hours to beat the game on Challenging (the hardest difficulty) and then I have spent roughly another 4 or 5 hours gathering the rest of the collectibles I missed and getting some extra trophies. I will say the game wasnt really that challenging which was a bit of a bummer.  I purchased the Deluxe Edition and the skins are pretty sweet but the coolest thing is the Buddy Pass which let one of my friends who otherwise would have never played the game play with me.  This game isnt as great as The New Order or The New Colossus but that doesnt make it a bad game. For $30 for the regular edition or $40 for the deluxe edition I consider it to be a great deal and a pretty great first person shooter title.  There are some downsides to the game such as a large amount of co-operative actions that slow the pace of the game down and a lot of elevator rides. Also on occasion the my AI controller sister wouldnt revive me when I was down which was incredibly annoying but did not happen more than a few times so although it sucked it didnt affect the overall experience too much. Overall I rate the game an 8/10 and if you are a fan of Wolfenstein games or single player (or co-op) shooters I recommend the game.;103301;;Co-Operative actions are too abundant and slow the pace of the game down a little.

3938;;Продолжение легенды. Действия игры разворачиваются после событий Crysis и Crysis Warhead. Номад погиб, об этом рассказывается в комиксе. Сам этот комикс важен и служит мостом между первыми двумя играми и самостоятельным дополнением. Главный герой сменился, теперь мы играем за Алькатраса. Псих куда-то пропал, а Пророк застрелился в самом начале игры. Игра стала более коридорной, для кого-то это может стать минусом, но я не считаю это отрицательной стороной игры, этой как минимум. Хоть игра и стала линейной, мы все еще можем решать как будет проходить бой. Можно перебить всех скрытно, а можно ворваться на поле боя с пулеметом и всех раскидать, все решать игроку. Забавно, но структура у игры все та же. Мы сначала сражаемся с обычными солдатами, потом встречаем пришельцев, ближе к концу игры встречаем союзников, а потом и встречаемся с финальной угрозой, которая по размерам больше чем Статуя Свободы.

3939;;An extremely impressive game. It feels extremely cinematic for its vintage, with the art and the music being entirely cohesive throughout. Because the entirety of the action takes place in essentially one futuristic location, the creators can’t lean on wildly disparate settings to keep things interesting. It has to be done in more subtle ways. Even so, the levels can get a little samey by the end, but there is a satisfaction and immediacy within the iterations upon their theme that you don’t get in other games that go in more obvious directions. This game is going for something that SUPER MARIO BROS. isn’t – a unified journey through the environment that represents a larger (if deliberately minimal) story. In short, it works. One can play this and immediately see it in the DNA of the post-LIMBO wave of cinematic platformers. SILIUS doesn’t have the same artistic or metaphorical ambitions of many of those games, but it seems similarly concerned with delivering an experience just as much as a twitch challenge. The music does a lot of the lifting in making that experience come together, too. It’s Sunsoft, so it’s a foregone conclusion that it will be awesome, but it’s above even their standards and delivers a pounding, thrilling backbeat to the player character’s relentless descent into sci-fi hell. As with some of the art, you can see an influence from sci-fi film soundtracks here, but the composers aren’t merely mapping an orchestra or synths onto the NES’ instruments -- they’re using the system’s strengths to give us something more fitting. These ambitions would mean next to nothing if the gameplay itself was broken, or even lacking, but thankfully it’s excellent. The controls and the combat are simple but very sharp, and this is important because the game is quite unforgiving. Crucially, the game never seems unfair – the enemies are plentiful and powerful, but their actions are legible and thoughfully designed. Enemies don’t respawn or attack you from behind, so you can move forward carefully and learn their weaknesses and how to use the environment to your advantage against them. You end up approaching each encounter like a puzzle, and there is always a solution that can get you through without damage. It’s very satisfying in a way that something like NINJA GAIDEN is not. This is a true hidden gem in the NES’ library and kind of unlike anything else I’ve played on the platform. A quietly influential masterpiece.;9159;;- Levels can be repetitive, but this is an artistic choice;;- Very strong, intentional design - The art and music elevate the levels into a cinematic journey;c;53165;321888
3940;So this game definitely isnt Curious Village or Unwound Future, and it isnt as good as either. I still enjoyed my time playing it though, despite all my criticisms. Maybe Im just really biased, I dont know. I still think this game is worth playing, especially for fans of the series.;GAMEPLAY: Of course, this game is largely based upon the Over 150 Brainteasers that are advertised on the cover art. They make up somewhere around like 90% of the gameplay. Overall the puzzles are pretty good. As there are so many puzzles, of course there are some really good puzzles and some rather meh or even bad puzzles. Despite me knowing that there are indeed those good puzzles, the bad ones tend to stand out more in my memories, and that kind of says something  The bad puzzles are more prominent than the good ones. Often times, the bad puzzles are bad either because A.) they are worded in a very confusing or poor manner or B.) they expect the player to think about some variable that isnt mentioned or sometimes even inferred by the puzzle. I can assume that point A is due to awkward translations, so that is kind of forgivable. Point B just leads to frustrating puzzles with solutions that make sense when you finally get it, but you dont feel accomplished by doing so, you just feel salty. That being said, the majority of the puzzles are still good, and the bad ones go away as soon as you solve them, so they dont stick around long. One positive I can say about this game compared to its predecessor is that Diabolical Box ties its puzzles into what is actually happening. No longer are the days of random person guarding a gate gives you a puzzle about drawing a star. The puzzles are now tied into the characters quirks or hobbies. Also, the minigames feel a bit more important. They are still completely optional, but they now give you something other than some bonus game modes that you can find in the main menu.  *MILD SPOILERS*  CHARACTERS: Professor Layton, Luke, and Flora are all still extremely strong characters. This is the first game where Inspector Chelmey is a secondary character, and his personality is in stark contrast to Professor Layton. They work well off of each other and can create some good moments. The four characters together to create a very strong character base. Unfortunately, the characters outside of that are forgettable at best.  STORY: Sadly, this is EASILY the weakest story in any Professor Layton game Ive played so far. The intrigue built up in the first and third games is not here. The game had presented me with a mystery but I found it hard to really care all that much  I just wanted more Professor Layton. I wasnt expecting the plot twist in this game but it also didnt blow my mind or anything.;1398;Ive been wanting to play Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box for a very, very long time. As a younger kid, I owned Curious Village and Unwound Future. I absolutely adored both of those games and how they blended fantastic stories (with awesome plot twists) and thought-provoking brain teasers. So, of course, I was always curious what secrets the second game in the series might contain.;A lot of poorly written or bad puzzles Forgettable side characters (besides Inspector Chelmey) Not very intriguing story;20;Most puzzles are good Puzzles are tied into what is happening Strong main characters;Brendos Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box Review;54819;320817
3941;На этом все, я перечислил все плюсы и минусы игры. Самой игрой я остался недоволен, вторая часть была сделана куда лучше.;Теперь поговорим о всех плюсах и минусах игры. Начинаем мы игру на крутой и прокачанной тачке, но потом у нас ее отбирают и дают на выбор несколько машин. После прохождения гонок и заездов на время мы открываем различного рода улучшения, а иногда и новые машины. Улучшения бывают разные, либо это улучшения внешнего вида кузова, либо всякие примочки по типу фар, неона и всего подобного. Ну а теперь о самом главном - тюнинг. На каждой машине есть три уровня прокачки по каждой критерии, будь то двигатель или же снижение массы. При выборе уровня прокачки нам дают выбрать список деталей, которые будут установлены в нашу машину, но это вроде как ни на что не влияет, поэтому я задаюсь вопросом Зачем???, так как реально, разницы между ними нет. Короче, это был первый плюс - тюнинг и стайлинг машины. Второй плюс этой игры - это несомненно музыка. Мы до сих пор напеваем различные песни из этой игры. Стоит только заиграть мелодии и мы уже подпеваем. Вот, это все плюсы, а теперь о минусах, их тут много. Первый из них - это управление. Оно вроде-бы нормальное, но нет. Сейчас объясню. Нам по стандарту дают ограниченное управление. Входить в управляемый занос сложно и почти невозможно,а разгон и повороты влево-вправо даются нелегко. Ближе к концу игры на экране загрузки я узнал, что это можно отключить, что я и сделал. Теперь стоит мне слишком долго поворачивать в какую либо из сторон и меня тут же разворачивает, игра считает, что я хочу войти в управляемый занос, но кнопку, ответственную за это я не жал. И такое случалось постоянно меня то разворачивало, то еще что. Второй минус - это геймплей. Нам предстоит пройти 112 гонок. 112 однообразных гонок, Карл. Это так надоедает, что ближе к концу игры у меня начала болеть голова. Третий минус - это случайные события, а именно гражданские, которые появляются просто из воздуха, и ладно бы их можно было объехать, но нет либо врезаешься, либо полностью останавливаешься и по краю проезжаешь. Четвертый минус - это скорость машин, сейчас объясню. Мы по сюжету игры можем получить эксклюзивные детали для машины, которые будут только у нас, но при полной прокачке и при этих деталях нас все равно могут обогнать и даже при идеальной езде догнать противников будет либо очень сложно, либо невозможно. Пятый минус - это конечно же сюжет. Он просто настолько заезженный в играх и фильмах про гонки. Мы были лучшим из лучших, но по стечению обстоятельств нас смешали с грязью, теперь надо взобраться на гору лидерства снова. Серьезно, мне пальцев на руках и на ногах не хватит, чтобы пересчитать все гонки с таким сюжетом.;96;Познакомился я с этой игрой этак в году 2012, сразу после прохождения второй части. Я решил опробовать и первую часть и узнать есть ли в обоих играх связанный сюжет. Спустя несколько недель я установил первую часть и прошел примерно 1/4 игры, но по обстоятельствам, которые я уже не помню игру я забросил. Спустя несколько лет, когда я приобрел себе Playstation 2 я купил себе также и Underground. Начал играть и столкнулся с проблемой сложности. Управлять на геймпаде мне было неудобно, поэтому пройти игру я не смог. И вот уже в 2019 году у меня дошли руки до нее.;1. Управление. 2. Геймплей. 3. Случайные события. 4. Скорость машин. 5.

3943;;The game starts out positive as you get to create your own character from a few different races, including Saiyan, Majin and Frieza and then play through an entirely new story. The story takes you back through some of most memorable moments in the Dragon Ball franchise where you attempt to put history right. As you level up you can allocate your attribute points to different areas that really change how you character fights.  However, the game got really frustrating for me when you try to work your way through the re-playable quests unlocked as you progress through the story. This is the main way to unlock new skills that your character can use. Unfortunately, they are kept behind walls of RNG. Some skills require defeating a certain enemy and some require completing the mission a certain way, but even if you do the drop is RNG, so it becomes a real grind-fest to get the ones you want. Its not helped by the AI of the team you take with you being really dumb and the enemy spamming their ultimate attacks which stun-lock you.  So for most an enjoyable game for a short time, but I think only the biggest of DB fans will get any replay-ability from it.;7408;;- Frustrating AI. - Lots of RNG. - Some of the stun-locking and move-cancelling during combat can be annoying.;;- Character customization. - New story. - Popular franchise.;c;55682;322132

3949;В итоге мы получаем очень хороший симулятор сбора компьютера, где мы можем не только собрать комп кому-то, но и себе.;Мы играем за сборщика компьютеров. В наши руки перешел офис, где нам и предстоит работать. Первоначально офис был один, но со временем разработчик добавил еще два рабочих места. Первое из них выполнено в стиле Razer. Повсюду зеленое свечение и их логотипы. Ну а второй в стиле ASUS, аналогично, как и с первым вариантом повсюду характерное свечение и их логотип. Со временем в игре будет меняться геймплей. Это, конечно же, первый плюс этой игры. Если в начале мы просто чистим компы от вирусов и от пыли, то под конец мы уже будем искать поломку в компьютере, полностью его разбирать и собирать, тестировать и разгонять. Все мелкие детали были соблюдены. Например, даже если вы собрали компьютер из самых лучших деталей и попытаетесь его разогнать по максимуму, то некоторые детали просто сломаются. Второй плюс этой игры - это настоящие бренды. Тут можно встретить Razer, ASUS, Intel, MSI, AMD, NVidia и многие другие всем нам знакомые бренды. Как говорится в описании игры цены на комплектующие указанны максимально приближенно к реальным. Ну и наконец третий плюс этой игры - это возможность создать ПК своей мечты. Вот серьезно, сомневаюсь, что я смогу в ближайшие 10-15 лет собрать себе комп с RTX 2080Ti и Intel Core I9, но тут можно это все собрать и кастомизировать как пожелаете. А теперь первый и последний минус этой игры - это плохой сюжет, а точнее тут он сделан для галочки. Можно было бы сделать более проработанную историю с логическим концом, но к сожалению тут этого нет.;27792;Впервые я познакомился с этой игрой, когда она только вышла.

3950;;Ill have to give a 7/10 although this was a great game to play.   First of all, the story was good (not great, good), long, and if you were going to play the game with all the sub-quests and watch all the media, it gave you the feeling of reading a sci-fi novel. At many time, the game was repeating itself and there was always this monotonous horror/sci-fi feeling with total absence of any new element. I was a nice experience, with excellent 3D graphics, with best of all, the ambience and the angst that you had from its claustrophobic feeling.;103329;;Repetitive at all parts of the game / Exhausting Mediocre atmosphere at many parts of the game After you lose from a battle, long waiting time It should have easy/medium/hard playability;;Great graphics;c;54601;322991
3951;;A very poor follow-up to ROCKET KNIGHT ADVENTURES on Genesis.   So whats new? The villainous pig army has been replaced by wolves. The smooth, fast, loose player character controls have been replaced by a muddy, plodding, inaccurate scheme. The gimmick-heavy, constantly changing stages have been replaced by endless platforming challenges with lots of cheap one-hit deaths. And maybe worst of all, the weird, lively soundtrack of Russian folk remixes (?!) has been replaced by bog-standard, sub-sub-MEGA MAN X farty SNES metal.  Not sure where this went wrong but this game has about a tenth as much personality as its predecessor. Weird.;1263;;- Gameplay slowed way, way down - Crap soundtrack - Boring levels;;- More Rocket Knight, I guess - Some of the art is passable;c;53165;323059
3952;;I think theres an argument to be made that, when it came out in 1996, this was the best looking video game ever made. The quality of art and animation is staggering. It almost hurts the playability because your focus will invariably be taken away from what youre supposed to be shooting every time some beautifully-rendered new enemy or set piece appears -- which, given the breakneck pace of this thing. is every couple seconds.  Youd think a game that looks this good and has elaborate, fluid animations for everything would have issues with the gameplay, but that is thankfully not the case. The controls are snappy and intuitive, and youll very rarely find yourself unable to do what you want within a split second of thinking it. This is important, of course, because the game is incredibly unforgiving. But no matter how much you die, youll have to keep pumping quarters into it to see what stunning sights are on the next screen over.  Interestingly, this game is also shockingly violent. Theres no blood anywhere (at least in the American release), but all the enemies are perfectly normal humans and youll slaughter them by the hundreds, watching them all die in lovingly crafted, weirdly realistic animations for the entire game. Somehow, this actually does not clash with the comedic tone of the thing, either. I dont know how it works, but it just does, and the game manages to be simultaneously horrific and droll when depicting the horror of war.  A weird, perfectly rendered vision of delirious combat action.;1404;;- Will take every quarter youve got, but itll be worth it;;- Unbelievable, epochal pixel art - Tight, simple gameplay - Just enough variety to be consistent yet interesting - Weirdly horrific violence sets it apart;c;53165;323083

3955;;No hace falta llevar décadas jugando videojuegos para saber que los Tactics no son el género favorito de los usuarios. Sin embargo, Disgaea llega con un tono descomplicado en el que a veces sientes que no hay límite para las horas de juego que le puedes invertir. Con una historia y personajes divertidos, así como mecánicas que parecen nuevas y clásicas a las vez, creo que es un juego al que hay que darle la oportunidad. (Si igual tienes dudas, dale una oportunidad a la demo).;26768;;- El gameplay puede ser demasiado complejo para el propio bien del juego.;;- El humor del título le da mucha personalidad. - Un universo de posibilidades de ataques y combinaciones.;c;56026;323155
3956;;Una experiencia inigualable. Si te quejas diciendo que este juego es solo un port de la versión de Wii U, hay dos cosas que debes saber:   1- Esta versión mejora cada aspecto del juego además de incluir un Modo Batalla SUBLIME.  2- La sola experiencia de poder disfrutar con amigos en cualquier lugar es algo que no vas a entender hasta que no lo vivas por tu cuenta.;26764;;- El 90% del contenido está desbloqueado desde el principio.;;- Infinitas horas de diversión gracias a la gran cantidad de modos de juego.;c;56026;323156
3957;;Nos guste o no Street Fighter II es uno de esos juegos que se resisten a morir. Un clásico que llega a Switch con una jugabilidad tradicional y la posibilidad de llevarte el juego a cualquier lugar.

3958;;Un juego grandioso que debe ser compra obligada para todos los usuarios de Switch. Tiene una jugabilidad única y divertida, el Grand Prix tiene una curva de dificultad bastante bien hecha y el online es bastante bueno. El juego parece simple pero es bastante técnico, por lo que si no te interesa dominar al 100% un juego te van a patear el trasero y si tu umbral de frustración es pequeño, aléjate de ARMS, porque no te va a parecer divertido.;26759;;- Hizo falta una mayor cantidad de modos de juego.;;- Una idea interesante con una buena ejecución.;c;56026;323158
3959;;Siempre he creído que el secreto de una buena secuela es cambiar suficientes cosas de la entrega anterior para ser algo nuevo, pero dejar suficientes para que no parezca una cosa totalmente diferente y en ese punto creo que Splatoon 2 logró el objetivo. Cambiar los ataques especiales, tener un modo Campaña mucho más pulido y la inclusión del modo Salmon Run le añaden horas de diversión a una fórmula que creó toda una comunidad desde cero en Wii U, (eso además de la inclusión de Splatnet 2 que amplía mucho la experiencia). Este es un juego para disfrutar online con amigos o en solitario y creo que es la mejor forma de que jugadores nuevos y con poca experiencia en jugar por internet incursionen en el online sin sentirse frustrados. ¿Recomiendo Splatoon 2? ¡¡Sin duda!!;26761;;- Los objetivos de los modos de juego no son tan claros para los principiantes.;;- Mucho contenido y diversos modos de juego. - El modo campaña para un jugador se agradece en un juego que se enfoca en el multiplayer.;c;56026;323159
3960;;Contra todo pronóstico, nos encontramos frente a un grandioso juego para los que aman el género de estrategia por turnos. La adición de los Rabbids nos da grandiosos momentos de humor y los desafíos le dan un grandioso factor de rejugabilidad. Mi única queja es que a veces el juego se freezea, pero para ser un trabajo de Ubisoft, es una muy buena incursión a la híbrida de Nintendo;28414;;- El juego se congela a veces, por lo que le faltó optimización.;;- Una forma muy diferente de jugar con Mario. - Carisma e historia a donde mires. - Buena curva de dificultad.;c;56026;323160

Lo único malo es que al terminar la historia principal, te das cuenta que la aventura apenas comienza XD. Los niveles en 2D son geniales, pero no vi venir la parte final en la luna.

3963;Clever yet simple gameplay? Great replayability? Cool design and presentation?  Quality game, recommend +1;The gameplay is incredibly in depth thanks to the wide variety of mechs to unlock leading to dozens of way to approach a campaign (making for excellent replayability), and yet its very basic and approachable. there are no endless hour long tutorials or anything. literally drop into battle and fight.  Each mech sets leads to very different approaches on the battlefield (i liked the sand ones best so far), and in each situation you will end up calculating your moves turns in advance. This is pretty much chess :D  I loved the presentation overall, from the isometric map to the retro scifi designs. Quality pixel art will remind some of Advanced Wars probably, which isnt a bad thing  );27117;Tactical or turn base isnt usually a genre to attracts me often, yet in the past few months ive had such great fun with Steamworld Heist that i decided there was maybe more to it for me, and im so glad i decided to explore the genre further.

3964;;Without a doubt, the best kart racer of this generation. Beenox did a great job of remaking a perfect game, and adding something of their own: customization options, pit stop, grand prix, and even new tracks. The only downside is the lack of single player fun without online - if you do not pay to play online, the game after the adventure mode loses an incentive for a player to play. It is especially a shame because the CNK tracks are not incorporated in the adventure mode, making them fun only for cups (which do not have the star rewards as in the original).;113113;;Short on game modes for single player Too much focus on online;;Awesome remake The same controls New customization options;c;47814;323202
3965;;Flow is a game I dont really get, but enjoyed it anyway. Once you get what the point is, you will be either consumed by the gameplay and eager to finish it, or you lose interest and will never play it again. Controls on PS4 are horrid, but the mechanics grow on you. All in all, good fun for two hours, but nothing more.;1353;;Controls Not for everyone Extremely short;;Catchy Premise;c;47814;323203
3966;;The graphics are absolutely beautiful  the physics, the particle effects, the lightning, the FMV integration with gameplay and the destructible environments look amazing in motion. The Twin Peaks and X-Files influenced story has a lot of weird nuances and backstory if you want to read a whole lot of letters and reports found in the game world.   Possibly the best game from Remedy.;103329;;-Checkpoints are sometimes far away. -The last encounter wasnt as fun as the rest of the game.;;-Gameplay mechanics -Story -Graphics;c;50759;323204
3967;;The game that started it all! Its a solid fighter mixing a bunch of Nintendos characters and placing them in a fight to the finish against a backdrop of classic locales. Use a Fire Flower to make Link back off you as he brandishes a Home-Run Bat, deck Pikachu with Marios forward smash, and get a serious case of red herring when Kirby copies Jigglypuff. Its a wonderful game, and is great for multiplayer. Competitive players will find that although not as in depth as Melee, 64 is a fast paced, punish heavy game. It definitely stands the test of time.;1626;;Story mode couldve been longer, but it was 1999!;;Super creative crossover action! Story mode;c;56046;323219
3968;;This game is AMAZING. Its an absolute must play and for the best experience you should play 999 first. I think that this is probably the best game of the trilogy, due in no small part to the complex, very meta plot the game presents as well as the philosophical;6614;;;;;c;56046;323232
3969;;Beautiful world, puzzles, platforming. Thats Journey. Well, kind of: Journey is different than other games of the same genre mainly by its goal. This game is not supposed to challenge you, or provide endless hours of fun. It is an experience, one of a kind story without words. However, it wont be for everyone. Casual gamers might have fun, a lot of players will find the game simply boring.;1352;;Short Slightly boring Rather melancholic;;Graphics World Experimental;c;47814;323233
3970;;Oddly enough, I find this game out of the three (flOw, Journey, Flower) the best. The world is pretty, the objectives are clear, the levels are different from each other so much that it makes you keep playing. Beautiful game, which once again (as its spiritual predecessor flOw) fails on controls: moving my controller is simply not my cup of tea.;1354;;Controls!;;Breathtaking environments Different levels Addictive;c;47814;323234
3971;;Played the Wii U version, which is my first ever experience with Bayonetta. In terms of aesthetic and charm, this game knows what it has and flaunts it at every chance it can. Its rare that a game can carry itself with this much swagger, with its titular character being the  most memorable. Sarcastic, witty, and a dominatrix in all other aspects, Bayonetta rules the screen as she battles the corrupt angels in a setting that would not be unfamiliar in rustic Italy. Bayonettas easy-to-learn, hard to master playstyle will have you button mashing to the end, as you help wickedly weave her way through to the games climax. Plenty of combos to try and interesting settings to explore, this is a game you wont want to miss;2136;;Some mandatory mini-games feel clunky to control;;A graphical delight Well written heroes with good voice acting Jazzy soundtrack fits very well with game style Intuitive battle system Sense of satisfaction when pulling off a Wicked Weave, Torture Move, or Summon;c;56046;323238
3972;;One of Kotaro Uchikoshis first forays into visual novels, Never7 explores the tale of a seemingly endless repetition of a students week at a seminar camp, which he attends with classmates Yuka, Okuhiko, and Haruka. Other characters include Kurumi and Izumi, two sisters who run a local cafe, and Saki, Yukas old friend who happened to be vacationing there. Later on, several different types of disasters play out depending on the players choices as they learn about the backstories of different characters. While some of the cast is definitely subject to certain archetypes, most of them have good chemistry and mostly believable interactions with one another. The CGs here and there bring life to a lot of them, while less can be said about their static low-res portraits. The game is fully voiced in Japanese, which is notable for its 2000 release date, and the cast is excellent in this regard. The pacing of the different plots can be somewhat sporadic, and the plots themselves vary in degrees of interest. Its a bit of a mixed bag, but some routes are particularly intriguing--Yukas route (the one most players will come across first) may seem a bit cliched but is still gripping nonetheless. Particular highlights go to Izumis routes, which has a couple of twists that throw the player for a loop and cause some philosophical introspection as the mysterious Cure syndrome is explored. The beach backdrop is a great fit and provides a relaxed feel for the slice-of-life parts, of which this game has plenty to spare. It may not be the most memorable game, but fans of Uchikoshis most likely will at least want to play a couple routes to experience a product of his earlier work.;18018;;Characters can be somewhat tropey and forgettable Pacing issues can lead to sluggish or rushed parts of the story Some plots not as gripping as others;;Mostly realistic slice-of-life elements Super voice acting Beach scene is a great fit for the plot Routes utilize a particular sci-fi component in a unique way, Cure syndrome proves to be of particular interest;c;56046;323240
3973;;A true sequel to the original METAL SLUG, retaining everything that made its predecessor great and surpassing it with a staggering amount of new art, fresh locations, and a couple surprising twists.   The new player characters and guns iterate slightly on the first games formula in logical ways and the levels and enemies reuse surprisingly few assets, opting instead for loads of beautifully crafted new pixel art. But the real excitement in this next chapter comes from the sudden shifts into horror and sci-fi that seem to come out of nowhere but nonetheless fit the universe and tone of METAL SLUG perfectly. This series excels at one-upping itself from stage-to-stage, even moment-to-moment, and these jarring left-turns are just the newest way to keep you awestruck and guessing as you press on through its relentlessly tough gauntlets.  As far as that difficulty goes, it looks like they put a little more effort into tuning than they did in the original. The first stage actually starts out surprisingly slow and easy, but by the time you get a couple stages in, its probably harder than ever before. While the moment to moment gameplay remains impeccable, a couple of the stages end up lacking in variety, turning into straight ahead marches through wave after wave of the same enemy types. I dont quite remember this happening in the first one as much. But a game with this much action has earned a couple slightly duller moments.  This sequel could have very easily been phoned in with mostly reused assets and ideas, but they really went the extra mile. I suppose that shouldnt be too surprising, given how high-effort the first game was, but its heartening to see developers pour so much love into their silly shooting games. Cant wait to see whats in the next one.;1407;;- A couple slow spots here and there;;- Rock-solid gameplay and tons of new ideas - Unexpected, thrilling turns for the story and setting - Has a truly epic ending that must be seen to be believed;c;53165;323239
3974;;A minor disappointment, despite retaining the same wonderful framework from the previous two entries.  The heavy human cost of developing all the gorgeous artwork for these games seems to have caught up with development a little bit, as this one definitely reuses more ideas and assets from METAL SLUG 2 than that game did from the original. Seeing the mummies and aliens appear in the second game was a genuine shock, but having whole levels based around them again in this one (with even some bosses reappearing late in the game) is disappointing, even if those more outlandish foes are joined here by zombies (complete with an attendant new transformation for your character, of course) and mutant animals.  On top of this, the final stage in this one repeats the general theme from the unforgettable finale of METAL SLUG 2, except drawn out into an absolutely endless slog that is more than half scrolling-shooter, which works well enough but is unwelcome when you just want more classic run n gun action.  These issues aside, it is still METAL SLUG, which means its a propulsive, creative, insane, violent bonanza. The gameplay remains tight and satisfying, and the art (old and new) is second to none. Hopefully weve seen the last of the aliens in this series and the next entries will have some fresh ideas.;1408;;- Reused ideas from the previous game - Absolutely interminable final stage;;- Core gameplay hasnt been messed with - More transformations and vehicles - The art still rules;c;53165;323460
3975;;Somewhat overlooked and worthy of revisiting, but doesnt do anything to address the issues the original version had.   Including all the DLC and updates (including the crucial ability to restart challenges from a menu) is nice, but all these extras are just plopped in your lap from the very start with no progression or unlocks, failing to integrate them meaningfully into the larger game.  Its still very, very fun to tool around and tear up the scenery, but this game always felt like it was missing something, and that hasnt changed with this re-release.;78153;;- A bit repetitive - Predates a lot of open-world QOL stuff that is now standard - Nothing much has been updated for this release;;- Fun core gameplay - Difficulty is well-tuned for the most part - Awesome crashes;c;53165;323461
3976;В итоге мы получаем интересную головоломку. Всем, кто не играл советую в нее сыграть, а также и в Machinarium, который я уже пошел проходить.;Мы играем за непонятно что. Это непонятно что зовут - Чучел. Игра начинается с его сна. Он просыпается ну и конечно, после сна надо поесть, но вот незадача, его единственная еда (вишня) была похищена огромной рукой. Теперь нам предстоит проходить различные логические загадки и двигаться к той самой заветной вишне. На пути к ней нам будет иногда помогать, иногда мешать какая-то фиолетовая мышь. Дело в том, что она тоже хочет съесть эту вишню, как и мы, поэтому происходит вот такая борьба за еду. Каждый уровень отличается от предыдущих, то нам надо просто жать одну и ту же кнопку, то нам надо решать головоломки. И это первый плюс этой игры - разнообразие. В игре даже есть нотки раннера, файтинга и других жанров. Второй плюс - это то, как игра выглядит. Такой стиль рисовки наблюдался еще в Machinarium, очень рад, что разработчики за такой большой промежуток времени сохранили свой стиль. В конце концов мы доберемся до этой самой руки, которая украла вишню. Оказывается, что это что то непонятное очень похоже на Чучела, только немного отличается. Я так понял, что в игре есть две концовки, либо я что-то путаю. В моем случае мне удалось склонить этого огромного Чучела на сторону добра и забрать вишню, которую в итоге поделили с той фиолетовой мышью. Потом пришел огромный Чучел и засыпал нас с мышью кучей вишни. После его заманили грушей и он за ней погнался, а заманила его огромная рука, которая больше громадного Чучела. Тут мы видим аналогию с началом игры.;57263;Познакомился я с этой игрой еще в первую неделю ее выхода. В игре был примерно такой же геймплей, как и в Machinarium, которую я пытался пройти еще в детстве, но не смог. Я решил сыграть в нее и посмотреть, но со временем забросил, пройдя примерно 1/4 игры. И вот, спустя год я решил вернуться в эту игру и наконец пройти ее.;-;6;1. Разнообразие. 2. Стиль рисовки.;Chuchel;54105;323487
3977;;It was fun until they told me that a thing I found out at the beginning of the game was supposed to be a big final and I should be surprised. I liked graphic style, music, story was interesting and I really wanted to know why all bad things happened and what will happen to other characters - Rose, Rod and his family, elderly man in the camp. Well, nothing was explained and after a big final I saw credits. I felt like creators tried to offend my intelligence.;11398;;final is so OBVIOUS explained nothing seemed to easy quite often;;graphic style music interesting idea no frustration;c;39817;323491
3978;;A grand Mario Kart experience introducing new features such as antigravity portions of tracks and the Super Horn, a hard counter to the Blue Shell. Deluxe contains all the DLC released for MK8 on the Wii U, meaning you have several more tracks at your disposal. Also, theres a handful of characters exclusive to this game, and the online experience is still pretty reliable for racing friends, people in your country, or even across the globe. Of particular highlight is the jazzy soundtrack, carried by a sassy sax as you weave your way to the finish line. Theres heavy potential to sink tons of hours into this game, from unlocking different kart parts to desperately trying to raise your online reputation. Smooth controls, beautiful layouts, and a dash of that Mario Kart magic make this another great entry in the legendary series you wont want to miss.;26764;;-Unlocking a specific kart part can be a chore due to the way the system is set up -Online experience suffers from connection issues here and there -Character/cups unlocked from the start;;-Beautiful game with great soundtrack -Smooth controls -As always, great multiplayer experience -Plenty of character and kart combinations for customizability -Hidden details show a lot of worldbuilding if you know where to look;c;56046;323494
3979;И действительно, эта игра так хороша, как мне и рассказывали мои знакомые в детстве. В таких играх сюжет не настолько важен. Более важен процесс получения удовольствия от логических задачек. Я считаю Machinarium одной из самых лучших игр-головоломок, если уж не самой лучшей.;Мы играем за робота у которого украли девушку, нам предстоит найти ее. В игре присутствуют локации. На каждой локации есть головоломки, а самое отличное это то, что все эти головоломки разные. Это и есть первый плюс игры - разнообразие геймплея. То мы решаем пятнашки, то мы играем в шутер с видом сверху. Вторым плюсом несомненно является рисовка игры - она просто замечательна. Как я выяснил во всех играх от этого разработчика рисовка выполнена в таком стиле. Что-то я отошел от завязки игры, надо бы это исправить. Наш главный герой просыпается на свалке, вдали от города, где он был со своей подругой. Для начала нам надо вернуться в город, но это не так просто как это может казаться. На пути в город нам предстоит решить не одну головоломку, но попав в город мы узнаем, что те роботы, которые похитили нашу девушку - это не просто бандиты, а террористы. Теперь нам предстоит не только спасти возлюбленную, но и предотвратить террористический акт. Именно это и получается у главного героя, после чего он спасается со своей девушкой. Конец.;2990;Познакомился я с этой игрой еще в детстве. Может быть это был 2010 год или чуть позже. Узнал я о этой игре благодаря знакомым. Они ее мне посоветовали пройти, что я и решил сделать, но в силу того, что я был мелкий дальше первых двух-трех локаций я уйти не смог. Но вот, время пришло и я здесь, пишу на нее обзор, спустя 10 лет с ее выхода.;-;6;1. Разнообразие геймлея. 2. Стиль рисовки.;Machinarium;54105;323504
3980;;Portal is broken up into two parts. In the first part you have to solve puzzles in test chambers and in the second part youre trying to escape from the facility. For my first playthrough the first part didnt give me too much trouble, because the difficulty curve is very well done. However, during the second part I often didnt know how to progress. This is because the exits are often hard to find and because Im used to modern games who dont allow you to destroy parts of the environment.;71;;- Second half of the game will likely give you quite some trouble on your first playthrough. - Short, but go play Portal 2 I guess.;;- Original concept - Great puzzles - Funny humour;c;35434;323527
3981;;If you want see hot anime girls, there are many cheaper ways to do that, like searching google &amp  will have endless better Hentai pix, or can try playing ( Mirror - Similar type game ) which you will pay once upon buying the game then will have full access to game contents ( Which is 1000 better than this Booty Call Shit, as well as no need to wait for health re-fill or next turn.  The worst game ever played in my life.;104803;;- Silly art, low detailed NOT hot girls  - Poor contents & bad story lines - Fixed dull girls images Lacking reactions - Long Waiting to progress. - Expensive in-game purchases ( Pay to win );;Free Play, but after short time will countered later by costly in-game purchases;c;14350;323533
3982;В итоге мы получаем отличную игру с отличным сюжетом и запоминающимся саундтреком.;Мы играем за Макса Пэйна - полицейского у которого убили жену и ребенка. После этих событий Макс попросту выпал из жизни. Жизнь стала играть только серыми красками. Макс договорился встретится со своим напарником, так как тот что-то нашел. Позже напарника убивают и мы нападаем на след убийцы. К концу игры мы узнаем, что виновна в смерти напарника простая пешка. Таким образом мы узнаем о организации, которая владеет почти всем городом и Макс знает, что ее глава виновата в смерти его родни. На след главного героя напала полиция - его бывшие друзья, так как они полагали, что Макс виновен в смерти напарника. Перебив всех шестерок мы все же добираемся до главы организации и убиваем ее. Во всем этом переполохе мы познакомились с одной девушкой, позже, во второй части она появится снова, там ей будет уделено больше внимания. Это был сюжет вкратце. Теперь поговорим о плюсах и минусах игры. Первый плюс - это сюжет, он просто на высоте. Второй плюс - музыкальное сопровождение. Многие из нас услышав ту самую мелодию из главного меню вспоминают про Макса. Третий плюс - это нуарная атмосфера, которой пропитана вся игра. Четвертый плюс этой игры - это ее хардкорность. Главный герой может умереть с одного выстрела в упор, а аптечек всегда будет не хватать. И пожалуй, единственный минус этой игры - это проблемы с запуском. Владельцы лицензии могли столкнуться с отсутствием звука, проблемой запуска игры в широком формате и многими другими проблемами. На этом плюсы и минусы закончились.;18;Познакомился я с этой игрой еще в году 2013, примерно. Я покупал диск, на котором была эта игра. В то время я играл во все игры, что были на диске, поэтому я даже не подозревал, что там может быть такой шедевр, среди всех остальных вялых игр. Еще тогда я прошел игру, но вот я решил перепройти все игры, которые проходил ранее, а также начать проходить новые проекты. К тому времени у меня на счету было около 350 пройденных игр. И вот, сначала.;1. Проблемы с запуском.;6;1. Сюжет. 2. Музыка. 3. Нуарная атмосфера. 4. Хардкорность.;Max Payne;54105;323535
3983;Возможно когда-то выйдет вторая часть, потому как даже в самом меню игры об этом говорится. Нам остается лишь ждать. В итоге мы получаем средненькую игру. Не сказать, что она прям очень хорошая, но и не сказать, что она плохая. Если бы не юмор в этой игре, то она бы не была такой успешной. Посмотрим, что будет дальше и будет ли вообще это дальше.;Эта игра - интерактивное кино. Наш главный герой просыпается от того, что его позвали. Мы видим нашего друга, который перед смертью успевает рассказать о том, что твориться в городе и что нужно жать X, чтобы не умереть. Собственно тут и кроется название игры. Главный герой отправляется к своей девушке, чтобы вместе сбежать из города. Сюжет тут конечно дырявый, очень много возникает к нему вопросов. К примеру куда они уехали, или же как они попали на склад, если шли домой к главному герою. Это и есть первый минус. И он тут один. Теперь о плюсах.Он тут тоже один. Это юмористичная составляющая игры. В игре множество смешных моментов, поэтому проходишь игру с улыбкой на лице. Есть отсылки к играм и фильмам. Вся игра состоит из диалогового окна и QTE. Чем выше сложность выбираешь, тем быстрее будут QTE. Также в игре ломается четвертая стена. И так в конце игры нам скажут сколько раз умер главный герой. В игре присутствует нелинейность, но она особо не заметна и на сюжет особо не влияет. От этой нелинейности появляются просто новые диалоги и монологи. На этом мое описание этой игры заканчивается.;13619;Познакомился я с этой игрой еще в 2017, благодаря Куплинову. Я посмотрел его прохождение по этой игре и захотелось сыграть самому. Но тогда времени сыграть в нее у меня не было. Лишь спустя 2 года после релиза у меня дошли до нее руки.;1. Сюжет.;6;1. Юмор;Press X to Not Die;54105;323579

3985;В итоге мы получаем, насколько мне известно очередную часть в серии игр от Rusty Lake, хороший паззл. Решать головоломки одно удовольствие, а наблюдать за странным сюжетом интересно.;Действие игры происходит в отеле Rusty Lake. Нам предстоит подготавливать пищу для здешних гостей, которых после каждого ужина будет все меньше и меньше. Дело в том, что мы готовим еду из наших же гостей и кормим этой едой других гостей. Это довольно интересный point-and-click паззл. У нас есть всего 5 комнат. В каждой комнате один из гостей. Нам предстоит решить ряд головоломок, чтобы получить его мясо. В конце игры мы готовим ужин для владельца отеля (мне так показалось), после чего нам показывают лифт, который движется в отель и нам говорят, что продолжение следует. Получается на этом все, пойду проходить следующую часть, а единственным плюсом могу отметить сами головоломки, они интересны, ну а минусов я не нашел.;18011;Познакомился я с этой игрой благодаря Куплинову. Эх, как же много хороших игр я узнал благодаря ему.Еще в то время я знал, что у игры есть много частей, но руки до них не доходили. И вот спустя столько времени они все же дошли.;-;6;1. Головоломки.;Rusty Lake Hotel;54105;323688
3986;;A more stripped-down, back-to-basics entry in the series.   Thankfully lightens up on the zombie and alien elements seen in the last two installments (although the former is still present, just not as much), but doesnt really replace them with anything new besides a mild focus on robotic enemies.   A tad brief and underwhelming (especially the finale) but not actively annoying in any way.;1409;;- Doesnt really offer anything new - Feels just a tad cut-rate - Its short, and the ending is weak;;- Eases up on some of the more tired aspects of the series - Still plays great and feels good;c;53165;323699
3987;;Extremely underwhelming sequel to beat em up high-water mark FINAL FIGHT that manages to lose nearly all of the charm of its predecessor.  Theres nothing wrong with the gameplay -- everything works perfectly well and the mechanics are standard and serviceable -- but there is just nothing of interest going on. The enemies are all based directly on ones from the previous game and there are next to no power-ups or weapon pickups. Theres literally about one item per level!  The presentation is weak, too. The art suffers a bit in comparison to the arcade version of the original, of course, but thats to be expected from the platform. Unfortunately, the music is incredibly forgettable, too. The plot takes the player on an endless, boring trip around the world that predictably ends in Japan, but youll be fast asleep before you make it anywhere near that far. The decision to take the characters out of Metro City and on a globe-trotting adventure seems to grossly misunderstand the appeal of the first game. At least Haggar is still around and still shirtless -- they got that much right.   Just dull. The blandest possible sequel to a great game.;1656;;- Boring as heck - Uninspired levels - No new ideas;;- Metro City Mayor Mike Haggar;c;53165;323703
3988;;Definitely the high-water mark for the Star Wars space shooters, eclipsing even its grander follow-up X-WING: ALLIANCE.  First and foremost -- it might be a guilty pleasure, but flying for the Empire in this game is just awesome. Feeling pride and security as the Star Destroyers come rolling in as opposed to abject terror is a thrill that we didnt dare dream of before this game came out in the 90s, and it still lands powerfully today. The plot and writing lean into it, with some excellent voice acting and story beats that really sell the different nature of being on this side of the galactic war. Having to deal with things like mediating minor civil wars and the business of actually governing unruly systems (in the satisfyingly haughty, condescending way of the Imperials, of course) within the Star Wars universe feels extremely fresh, and soon youll find yourself itching to wipe out those indignant Rebels whenever you get the chance. Playing as the villains has rarely been done this well.  The flying and combat are great, too. Everything has evolved from STAR WARS: X-WING in exactly the right direction, and the missions are straightforward and legible, leaving the heavy lifting of the plot to the well-rendered cutscenes and mission briefings between flights.  A more-or-less one-of-a-kind game in the Star Wars canon, which is a shame, but its no less playable today than it was when it came out. Still different, still thrilling, and vital for a series fan or anyone missing this type of game.;166;;- The 3D graphics are a little archaic, but not disastrously so;;- Getting to play as the bad guys is a blast - Really excellent presentation (sprite work, voice-over, menus) - The mechanics are much, much better than its predecessor;c;53165;323707
3989;В итоге мы получаем еще один хороший паззл с запутанным сюжетом и интересным окружением.;Как и во всех остальных частях серии жанром выступает паззл. Наша цель - выбраться из комнаты. Как мы можем заметить, в последующих частях серии такой стиль паззлов сохранится. У нас есть несколько комнат и нам предстоит перемещаться из одной в другую, чтобы решить все головоломки и выбраться из комнаты. Сюжета тут особого нет, как и в последующих частях. Но если воспринимать все эти части цельно, то можно понять, что у игры есть своеобразный лор. Тут и мистический ворон и какая-то главная Сова, короче, что-то непонятное. Как и с прошлой пройденной мной частью, из плюсов выделю интересные головоломки, а минусы тут и вовсе отсутствуют.;75123;Наткнулся на эту игру я пытаясь побольше узнать о серии игр Rusty Lake.

3992;Мы можем увидеть как развилась студия Rusty Lake. Они перешли от обычных паззлов к паззлам с дополнительными концовками. Их проекты стали более масштабными. В скором времени я пойду проходить Rusty Lake Paradise. Очень надеюсь, что разработчики добавили в нее какое либо нововведение, по сравнению с предыдущими частями.;Roots это еще одна часть серии игр Rusty Lake. Тут сюжет вертится вокруг семьи и семейного дерева. Все начинается с того как будущий отец трех детей прибывает в дом своего отца (если не ошибаюсь), теперь это его дом, ведь он переходит к Джеймсу (отец трех детей) по наследству, в связи со смертью так сказать его отца. Как же все запутанно. Короче, потом рождаются дети и со временем начнут убивать друг друга. В игре всего 33 уровня с головоломками, а также есть еще один - дополнительный. О нем чуть позже. На каждом уровне нам предстоит решать головоломки и наблюдать за сюжетом. В конце концов дерево разрастется до таких размеров, что оно впитает останки предков и поглотит правнуков умершего деда, которому принадлежало поместье. После чего нам предложат разузнать побольше о самом доме и истории семьи, а также дадут подсказку, где именно искать. И таким образом от подсказки к подсказке мы будем двигаться к дополнительной концовке. После ее получения мы увидим как Мистер Ворона стал таким, да и вообще узнаем недостающие детали сюжета. Из плюсов как и в прошлых частях выделю интересные головоломки, а также вторым плюсом засчитаю дополнительную концовку. Минусов нет.;25222;Знакомство вообще со всей серией Rusty Lake у меня произошло благодаря Куплинову.

3995;;In the end, I wanted to like the game more than I did, but I just felt like there was something off. After beating the first four worlds and finding out I was only half way through the game, I was exhausted, only pushing myself to finish for the sake of completion. Id honsetly rather not have the unlockable skins since I ended up not wanting to use any of them and always felt let down. Although I didnt expect much from the story, It was worse than I could have guessed, leaving me with no idea what went on in the final level, ironically named the reveal. It was by this point that I started to realize how inconsistent some of the hitboxes were, where some points I thought I was ok would end up in my death, whilst others where I thought Id be dead, ended up surviving.  The controls are good enough, although feeling inconsistent between characters, the game they defintely feel unique to the game. The art style is a highlight, with vibrant colors that just make you feel good.  The highlight of the game is the distinct soundtrack which I surely wont remember.;981;;;;;c;8607;324020

3998;;Once starting this DLC, in you’ll be greeted with a warning that you should complete the Main story of the Base game, before playing the DLC. While the other DLC of all Borderlands games assumes that you did complete the base game, but outside of a few returning characters that you should have meet during the story most of previous DLC doesn’t really pickup any major Story point of the game. Commander Lilith revisits places and story points from the finale of base game. Help drive this point in, DLC starts art Level 30 for the weakest enemy, which is level of the base games’s Final boss, and goes up to 38, all on the “Easiest” setting.  This DLC start with you failing to Defend the Main Story’s hub area Sanctuary, from Zombie like Creatures and plants, from under the command of Colonel Hector. Sanctuary is a old Space Ship with a City built on top of it, currently flying over the planet of Pandora. As the Ship/city is under attack, it’s your job to get take down what you can.. Sadly the Plants over run the city, and Lilith, a Siren, uses her magical powers to teleport everyone to the ground and in to relative safety.  We soon meet Vaughn, a former Hyperion Accountant, from the Tales of the Borderlands game. He lets the player with Lilith and several of the people of Sanctuary use the place as temporary base.  Soon after this you start working on trying to retake Sanctuary, getting help from from the other people of Sanctuary and a few other people. As for if they do it or not? You’d have to play the game.  In Borderlands 2, we don’t see Lilith show her skills as a “leader” of Crimson Raiders, who are based Sanctuary. The leadership role was Roland, until his death, but due to being kidnapped around the same time, she couldn’t really do anything until the post game. While she acted like the leader, the few appearances, but it was more of a blink and miss it mode. As in the 9 other Story based DLC, Lilith is not seen or heard, or she was not in a situation that call upon her leadership abilities. In the Pre-Sequel, it ended up showing her understandable anger with certain group more than her being a level headed leader of the Crimson Raiders.  Another Character, “Tiny” Tina also got to stretch her limits. For the in Previous appearances of the game, she didn’t try to physically help the player, she often was a Quest giver and a voice on the Radio, and was never seen out side of her “safe” areas. The Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep DLC offered us a chance to help her comes to terms with the Death of Roland, while we as played in her D&amp D-style game. This time she begged Lilith to user her Magic powers to transport Tina to certain Area, and even go take point on a side missions with other characters in the game. This is partly to set her and those characters up for upcoming Borderlands 3.  Gameplay wise, there is nothing outside the normal for a Borderlands 2 player, It feels like game you played to death then finding an area that you didn’t knew exist.  As this is the last DLC for Borderlands 2, they didn’t have the the need to show off tech, mostly as most game developers has moved on to UE4 engine over UE3 engine used to make this game. Most of the games and DLC did something new that wasn’t done with the engine or within Borderlands as a series. Given that Unreal Engine 3 used to make the game was already mature by 2012, it was mostly to take advantage of Tech that could be added to the engine. As with the DLC, most of the “PhysX” effects that littered the PC version of base game, was limited, usually to pre-exiting assets.  As most of the Borderlands 2 playable characters are not due to return in Borderlands 3, the Voice Actors where not on hand to record new lines. So the player characters didn’t get new voice lines, nor did they speak outside of the standard response lines that they had in the base game (or in their DLC packs for DLC characters Gaige &amp  Kreig). However, one voice actor did change for a minor character, it is quite noticeable, especially when base game has the Original Voice actors lines.  TL DR  If you’re fan of Borderlands, I’d say buy it. The story and a few missions are long enough to hold you over until Borderlands 3 is released. The extra levels to 80 won’t matter to the Casual Market, but the hardcore players have more area to play in and more challenges and gear to get.  Review Note: At the time of writing, the DLC is free for any owner of Borderlands 2 (or Borderlands: The Handsome Collection) for PC, PS4 and Xbox One until July 8th 2019. I obtain my copies of the DLC with with this free promotional offer. However, I did buy the PC Base game and Season Pass back in 2012 with my own money, and all the other DLC over the years. I also purchased the PS3, and PSVita versions of Borderlands and the PS4 version of The Handsome Collection.   This review was initially posted from MikeSharpeWriter .

3999;;Sorry but this is not type of game in my opinion it could be considered a repetitive Movie with some interactions   They spent very long time making such huge content of Video Clips but regretfully without variety to attract the player,  Actually we play games to interact on alternative realities &amp  see new wonders &amp  strange things away from real life,   Here even they not changed the location of Doctor Clinic thru all the game scenes, Always in everyday sessions using same sofa from same view angle and background, it was good that some actresses changed their outfits thru differ sessions, but nothing else have any diversity   I couldnt like the game even I try a lot after seeing obtained Guinness rewards.;25264;;;;;c;14350;324210

4005;В итоге мы получаем хороший tower defense с видом от третьего лица. Таких игр я больше не знаю, кроме серии Orcs Must Die! Проходить ее одно удовольствие.;Игра начинается с рассказа одного из самых лучших магов, которому предстояло всю свою жизнь охранять порталы от орд орков, но случилось непредвиденное. Этот маг поскользнулся и ударился об одну из ступеней. Это и стало причиной его смерти. Казалось бы, вот и все, мир за порталами обречен, но нет, у этого мага был ученик, на плечи которого упала огромная ответственность. Теперь ему предстояло защищать порталы до конца своей жизни. Именно за него мы и играем. Учитель не верил в своего ученика и считал его ужасным магом. Вскоре мы узнаем, что у орков есть предводитель. До этого все считали, что у них нет цели. Окажется, что бывшая девушка-маг встала на темную сторону и повела орков на порталы, которые мы и обороняем. Теперь у противника была цель и его атаки стали более организованными. Нашему главному герою будет казаться, что он последний маг и вся эта проблема с орками только на его плечах, возможно так и есть, но насколько мне известно в последующих частях будут и другие маги. Нашему герою все же удается остановить нескончаемые орды противника, но какой ценой? Ценой отсутствия магии за порталами. Он закрыл их и тем самым оставил мир за порталами без магии, странно, но в игре из этого сыграли  трагедию, типа, если будет засуха, то попросить мага навести тучи уже не получится, для нас, обычных людей, это не проблема, как бы подождем дождя и все будет хорошо, но в игре из этого сделали не пойми что. Теперь, когда я поверхностно рассказал о сюжете игры, давайте поговорим о ее плюсах и минусах. Мы можем заметить, что постепенно с прохождением игры будет увеличиваться и сложность. Это несомненно плюс, ведь нам предстоит больше продумывать оборону портала, а иногда и порталов. Орки заходят через двери, бывают случаи, когда этих дверей несколько, так в финальной миссии дверей будет четыре.  Вторым плюсом я засчитаю саму реализацию игры, а именно tower defense с хоть каким то сюжетом и видом от третьего лица. Я больше таких игр не знаю и для меня, как любителя этого жанра эта игра просто находка. Третим плюсом я считаю множество возможностей прохождения уровня. Мы можем сами создать свой стиль обороны. С прохождением уровня нам будут открываться новые ловушки, что еще сильнее расширяет наши возможности. Мы можем повсюду расставить шипы, или же огненные плиты, короче говоря, чем лучше у вас воображение, тем вам лучше будет. Также ловушки можно подстраивать под обстановку локации, чтобы поршни спихивали орков прямо в бездну, кстати говоря локации меняются из уровня в уровень, что делает каждую оборону уникальной. Пожалуй единственным минусом я посчитаю баги. Так, к концу игры я открыл стражников с мечами, я их ставил примерно в линию и они никого не атаковали. Или же бывали такие случаи, когда лучники не стреляли по врагам, которые бегут прямо на них, а просто стояли. Так что особо рассчитывать на ИИ не стоит. А, чуть не забыл сказать о отсутствии возможности проходить игру с другом. За минус я это конечно считать не буду, возможно как то это все таки и можно сделать, но я не смог сыграть с другом.;2355;Мое знакомство с игрой произошло в году 2012, может в 2013, точно не помню. В то время я считал, что детали для компьютера слишком дорогие и не пытался собрать деньги на его апгрейд. Именно поэтому я искал игры для слабых ПК. Стоит сказать, что мне очень нравится жанр tower defense, поэтому узнав об этой игре я был на седьмом небе от счастья. Я тут же скачал ее, но со временем забросил, не пройдя даже половины игры. Но вот я вернулся к этой игре и решил закончить начатое, спустя примерно 6 лет.;1. Баги.;6;1. Нарастающая сложность. 2. Реализация игры. 3. Разные вариации прохождения.;Orcs Must Die!;54105;324372

4007;В итоге мы получаем отличный стелс-экшн, который оказал большое влияние на игровую индустрию.;Мы играем за Агента 47, многим геймерам известным как лысый убийца. Тут рассказывается начало его истории. О том как он пошел против своего создателя. Сюжет в игре был проработан, как мне кажется, не очень хорошо, ведь все самое важное можно узнать в первой миссии и в последней. В первой мы знакомимся с Агентом 47, все остальные миссии устраняем цели,а в финале убиваем своего создателя и других Агентов, которые кстати говоря наши копии, хотя правильней будет сказать, мы одна из копий. К сожалению это и был первый минус. Сюжет тут плоховат, опять таки говорю, это лично мое мнение, оно может не совпадать с вашим. Раз уж мы начали с минусов, тогда давайте и продолжим о них говорить. Вторым минусом я считаю неудобное управление. Большинство из нас привыкло просто зайти в игру и получать удовольствие от игрового процесса, но тут первоначально управление не было настроено вовсе, камера управлялось не пойми как. Надо было хорошенько порыскать в настройках, чтобы настроить все под себя, но и тут проблемы не заканчиваются. В игре все равно остаются проблемы с подбором предметов и взаимодействием с окружающей средой.  Пожалуй последним минусом справедливо будет посчитать отсутствие хоть каких либо сохранений на уровне. Почти прошли уровень, но вас кто-то заметил и из за этого накрылось все задание? Ну ничего, играйте заново. Кажись, если бы игра была человеком, то она так бы и сказала. А теперь давайте поговорим о плюсах. В свое время эта игра была прорывной среди стелс игр. Воистину, стелс тут выполнен просто хорошо. Помимо этого персонаж может взаимодействовать практически со всем окружением. Это были два первых плюса, ну а теперь о третьем, как мне кажется о самом важном плюсе этой игры. Речь конечно же идет о вариациях прохождения игры. У нас есть уйма возможностей для прохождения каждого уровня. Каждый из уровней можно пройти несколькими способами, но к сожалению на финал это не повлияет. Как бы там ни было это очень весомый плюс для такой игры.;1050;Интересен тот факт, что я начал проходить серию игр про лысого убийцу начав с Absolution. Именно она была моей первой игрой в серии. Мне очень сильно понравились игры такого жанра и поэтому я решил пройти всю серию целиком. Первой игрой в серии была Codename 47, которой в этом году вот вот исполнится 19 лет и пришло время ее перепройти. Мое первое прохождение было в году этак 2015, поэтому я особо не помню события игры, но вот пришло время освежить память.;1. Плохо проработанный сюжет. 2. Неудобное управление. 3.

4008;В итоге мы получаем шедевр с однообразным геймплеем, невыносимыми случайностями, плохим сюжетом и плюс огромным количеством глав.;История разворачивается вокруг злых птичек. Их враги - свиньи, постоянно воруют яйца птиц. Вот и все, это основная завязка сюжета. Это даже сложно сюжетом назвать. Именно в этой части есть около 10 глав. Во всех этих главах геймплей однообразен. Я понимаю, что для мобильных устройств это нормально, уровни можно проходить пока находишься в отъезде, но не более. Эта игра просто трата времени, не более. Конечно радует, что иногда разработчикам в голову приходила хоть какая-то идея помимо постоянного истребления свиней, и они делали немного отличающиеся уровни. В основном такие уровни были в конце главы. Также в этой игре очень многое зависит от удачи. К примеру, я как то раз застрял на одном из уровней, из раза в раз я делал все одни и те же броски, но вот исход был разный. То камень нужный не сломается, то еще что. Это очередной минус этого шедевра игровой индустрии. В начале обзора я сказал о количестве глав. И это неспроста. У меня вопрос Зачем?, типа серьезно, зачем так много однообразных глав, единственным различием между которыми является способ похищения яиц, но как я и говорил ранее, сюжет тут ужасен, так что это особой роли не играет.;2035;Как и я, большинство геймеров познакомились с этой игрой благодаря мобильным устройствам. Позже я узнал, что эта игра была выпущена также на компьютер. И знаете, тогда мне нравилась эта игра и остальные в ее серии игры, но прошло очень много времени и мое мнение об этой игре очень сильно изменилось.;1. Однообразный геймплей. 2.

4009;Еще одно доказательство того, что игры по фильмам в основном не удаются. Есть конечно исключения, но это редкость.;Мы играем за Железного Человека, кто бы мог подумать. В те времена клепать игры по фильмам было прибыльно и многие посмотрев Железного Человека шли играть в эту игру, владельцам консолей повезло, у них хотя бы графика в игре нормальная, но вот владельцам ПК ой как не повезло. Игра была просто ужасным портом с консолей. Графика была времен первого Playstation, анимация на уровне переходов в Powerpoint, сюжет куском кое чего, а сам геймплей ужасом геймера. Пойдем по порядку. Графика по сравнению с консолями была очень сильно урезана. После 30 минут игры у вас будут болеть глаза. Анимации в игре были сделаны очень странным образом. У нас есть начало анимации и ее конец. Связующего звена нет. Сюжет это вообще отдельная тема. Планировалось, что игра будет повторять сюжет фильма. Первая и последняя миссия повторяют, а вот все остальные непонятно что. Очень многие вещи в игре очень глупы. К примеру миссия в заснеженной локации, это где-то в России, если не ошибаюсь. Старк прилетает, закрывает контейнеры которые излучают радиацию и улетает. Типа то, что он закрыл контейнер помешает его открыть, гениально разработчики, вы гениальнее разрабов Скайрима, которые выпустили игру уже почти на всем, чем угодно и высасывают деньги из чего угодно. Короче вы поняли, сюжет кусок кое чего. А теперь о самом важном в абсолютно любой игре - геймплее. Тут он однообразен. Каждую миссию мы летим, разносим врагов, иногда сражаемся с боссами. Думаю продолжать разносить эту игру не стоит, итак она очень многое повидала. Единственным плюсом посчитаю только песню Iron Man, и то она на оценку игры не повлияет.;4935;Знакомство с этой игрой произошло еще в 2008-2009 году, точно не помню в каком. Я был тогда ребенком и мне очень нравились игры про супергероев. Возможно, я точно не уверен, это была моя первая игра про какого-либо героя. В те времена она мне нравилась и я ее даже несколько раз перепроходил, но вот время прошло и мои взгляды на эту игру изменились.;1. Сюжет. 2. Геймплей. 3. Графика. 4. Анимации.;6;1.

4010;;Campaign is only 4 chapters, but they are longer as a couple of them include a large free roam area. Probably about 20 hours long but as its one of the more enjoyable GOW campaigns I would have liked a bit more. It now includes 3 player co-op with the third player controlling Jack the robot, who can be upgraded with new skills and components found throughout the game. My first playthrough was with Jack and it gets more and more enjoyable as you progress.  Horde has changed slightly with each character having their own skill cards and ultimate attack rather than there being set classes. Each character has dedicated experience which unlocks more skill cards. And rather than selecting a set difficulty you can select modifiers to make it more challenging.  Escape is the new 3 player mode with its own set of characters. The objective being to escape a hive starting with only pistols and against the clock as a toxic venom makes its way through the hive behind you. I think the idea is that this will get regular updates to the hive like a lot of games are doing with periodic content.  All in all I like all of the changes they have made from what I have seen so far and I feel I will get more out of this GOW than some of the recent ones.;103292;;- Connectivity issues at lunch, especially with early access.;;- Looks great and runs smoothly even on base consoles. -Three player coop options. - Plenty of game modes to keep it entertaining.;c;55682;324385
4011;;Why are the two FINAL FIGHT sequels so phoned in? This one is, somehow, even worse than the last -- just as dull, but this time with uncharacteristically weak art and animation to boot.   When I played FINAL FIGHT 2, I complained about the dumb globe-trotting plot and how abandoning the urban decay of Metro City was a critical misunderstanding of what made the first game great. Well, I got my monkeys paw wish fulfilled. Were back in the city for this one but its drained of all personality and might as well just be blank backdrops. Equally blank are the new characters, Dean and Lucia (it was a stretch for me to even remember their names), and dont even get me started on Haggars hideous new ponytail ...  Pretty much the only bright spot I can think of is in some of the enemies behavior. A couple of the mooks and bosses differentiate themselves well with legible, learnable attack patterns that reward paying attention and fighting smartly. Unfortunately their designs are, like the rest of the game, extremely unoriginal.   Its baffling to me that Capcom didnt put more behind these two SNES sequels. FINAL FIGHT is a legendary game that defined a genre and holds up to this day, but it could have been a real franchise if not for these turds.;1657;;- Weirdly lackluster art for this series, and for Capcom - Everything about it is boring and done to death - Haggars new look;;- Some interesting enemy behaviors;c;53165;324430

Manages to recapture some of the magic of the early games by refocusing on soldier-to-soldier and soldier-to-tank combat, but it sports a lot of new art and designs rather than relying on the same old assets from the last four. Everything works great as usual and there arent as many frustrating or dull sections like in METAL SLUG 3 or METAL SLUG 4, but some of the bosses are still a bit lacking. Even so, each of the levels are fairly original, and its good to see that there are still some fun settings and themes that they havent done yet. The final boss is refreshingly weird, but is kind of one-note and underwhelming.  Glad that this series still has some life left in it.;1410;;- No big shakeups;;- Same old frantic combat is still fun, even after all these games - A good amount of new stuff going on here;c;53165;324431
4013;;Below was my review on First Super Seducer Game, Which in my opinion was a way better than this sequel    Sper Seducer 1: Novel style game about Dating &amp  hot girls seduction, the game falls into many short chapters having video-clips narratives driven by multiple choices.

4017;;Portal 2 takes some steps forward and some steps backwards. The setup is pretty similar to Portal: test chambers and environmental puzzles. However, Portal 2 adds a great story to the mix. For the most part the difficulty of the puzzles is on point, but some elements werent explained well (like the gel can kill turrets). The environmental puzzles are also better than in the original, though there are still some obscure parts. The singleplayer is twice as long as the original, which also great.;72;;- Puzzles mostly have only one solution - Couple of badly introduced puzzle rules - Some obscure environmental puzzles;;- Humorous AIs - Great story - Twice as long as Portal;c;35434;324568
4018;;The game takes a great turn from its usual turn-based outings on this spinoff tactical JRPG from Squaresoft.

God bless Social Justice!  - Typical Nazi Man Bad, American Men Good (yes, the protagonists are actually men born in female bodies)  - bugs, crashes, freezes, and Denuvod so big I lost literally 15 hours (out of my 30 hour playthrough). And I couldnt even finished the game as when I was fighting the last boss, the games crashes so hard my save slot was entirely erase. Congrats!  - Had so use cheats and mods so the game remotely resembled an actual Wolfenstein game in terms of gameplay and HUD. Even then, enemies were always made of sponge and the constant respawn of enemies, which makes me think if the entire game was meant to be artificially extended and isnt made for us to use...  - Microtransactions, and in a Singleplayer game. What a time to be alive, gents!  - No pause feature, on a supposedly advertised singleplayer game  - No checkpoints whatsoever. Together with the game crashing every 30 minutes, it makes the whole experience a real cherry. Til you actually just say feckit and rushed to the end of a mission hoping it doesnt crash on the last dialogue. In fact, they should tag this game as a Souls-like game, but instead of dying, the game crashes, and instead of losing you stuff, you lose your save file!;;- Gameplay fluid-ly superb with a lot of variety of weapons and playstyles (when the game is actually working)  - The graphics are some of the best Ive seen on PC (High+ settings)  - Very good optimization (when the game isnt crashing every 30 minutes)  - Very interesting collectibles, which make quite an interesting read  - Mond Mond Ja Ja  - Story is short, as just another cutscene more with those awful characters and I wouldve erased the save slot myself.  - Environment and level design are top notch, courtesy of the collaboration with Arkane. I had so many Dishonored vibes.  - Main missions (although poor) worked well with the inclusion of side missions, unlocking new areas in previously traveled locations;c;27071;324648
4020;;Its short and kind of simple, but GOLDEN AXE nails the fundamentals of the beat em up and adds a couple of intuitive twists to the formula that set it apart from its contemporaries without making things too complicated.  The story, setting, and characters are pretty cliched, but well-sketched and fun. The art is great and perfectly captures the classic Vallejo/Frazetta vibe, and, while not the highest fidelity, is at least consistent and legible. Colors of the characters are bold while the levels are grounded with muted earth tones. Overall, very satisfying.  The basics of the combat are great as well. Nothing terribly flashy, but characters move and attack at the right speed for the size and the playing area, and youre more mobile than usual with a dash attack and a high jump during which you can get off multiple attacks. The couple moments of platforming (usually a big problem control-wise in games like this) are no big deal because you feel pretty well in-tune with your character. The enemies attack patterns arent overly complex, but theyre not cheap and give an appropriate level of variety and challenge.  The twists to the formula come in the form of the magic system and the rideable monsters, which are both superb additions.   Magic, gained by picking up potions, replaces the standard beat em up super moves, but the beauty here is the variety, yet simplicity of its usage. The more pickups you stockpile, the better the spell will be when you finally release it, with four levels of growth. Each of the three playable characters has their own unique sequence of spells, and its even fun to get the potions because instead of just lying around, you have to knock them out of fast-moving gnomes that flit around the battlefield while you fight. The quicker you are to combo the little guys, the more pickups you get, so its almost a little minigame breaking up the action. From fighting for the potions, to seeing what kind of magic each character has, to reaping the rewards of a huge, screen-clearing attack by saving up, this extra system is intuitive and fun all the way around. Probably the best of its type in a beat em up to this point.  The magic would honestly be enough to differentiate GOLDEN AXE, but the rideable monsters take the standard weapon pick up to a new level. A couple times per stage, a mook will ride in on a powerful mystical beast of some kind, and if you can knock them off and beat them to it, you can mount it yourself and wreak havoc on the bad guys indefinitely ... until you get knocked off yourself. Fighting with the enemies over control of the beast is thrilling, and when you finally get the upper hand and start roasting everybody with dragon fire, you feel incredibly empowered and want to do everything you can to keep the monster all the way through the stage.  GOLDEN AXE shows that sometimes the best way to make a successful game is to perfect the core elements of the genre and then add one or two well thought out elements to complement it. Great graphics and sound, a gentle difficulty curve and strong fundamentals pair with the simple but fun new elements in a way that is extremely satisfying and it leaves you wanting more. A well-respected classic for a reason.;5565;;- Short but sweet;;- Powerups are clever and very well done - Great art and music - The three playable characters are iconic and just different enough;c;53165;324664
4021;;(Arcade Version)  Its the grandfather of the beat em up genre, so not everything is perfectly thought through or polished yet, but there is a surprising amount of quality here. The art is expressive and fun, theres a good variety of areas and enemies, and the tone is slapsticky and non-serious in an amusing, engaging way. Having different buttons for punching in different directions is disorienting and doesnt work very well, but there are fleeting moments where fending off guys on both sides with this setup is exciting.   A good start.;6852;;- A bit hard to play with some unorthodox controls - Strict time limit that seems unnecessary;;- Great art for the characters and environments - Pretty propulsive and fun;c;53165;324709

4028;;At first, I found the combat system to be really chaotic, especially in comparison to how clear the first Theas combat was. Thankfully, after spending some time with it, Id say its a definitive improvement both in depth and variety of options. The crafting was likewise expanded, but sadly I didnt warm up to it over time. The addition of many new resources and research tiers feels mostly like an unnecessary bloat.   It is entirely possible to play the entire game as a nomad, which is an interesting option. Personally, Id rather see the village management become more in-depth, though.   My main gripe with Thea 2 is how repetitive it can get. Thankfully, autoresolve works pretty great now, so if you dont want to slog through identical encounters, you dont have to. Despite the monotony sneaking in at times, the events and character options are quirky and fun enough to have kept me glued to my chair for almost a week straight.   All in all, even though some of the changes are a sidegrade at best, its still a really charming game.;110415;;- Monotonous after a while - Shallow village management;;- Quirky and unique - The new combat system - Turning my children into giant snakes;c;56457;324872
4029;;If you are a perfectionist, I highly suggest you leave that at the door when playing this game.

4040;Первая часть в серии и как по мне - это середнячок. При всех ее минусах играть в нее мне было не комфортно, но вот чего у нее не отнять, так это отличного сюжета и ее атмосферы. За это ее и полюбили. Ну а моей любимой частью в серии по прежнему остается третья часть - Зов Припяти.;Нам повествуют об истории Стрелка, который потерял память и попал в труповозку, но благодаря удачному стечению обстоятельств его спасли и он со временем пришел в себя. Теперь он думает, что его зовут Меченым, а его главной целью является убийство Стрелка, то есть самого себя. По мере того, как он приближался к следу самого себя, как бы странно это не звучало, он начинал понимать, что этот Стрелок не просто какой-то там сталкер. Он был одним из немногих, кто смог пробиться на север Зоны. Ближе к концу игры он узнает, что он и есть этот самый Стрелок. Теперь нам предстоит узнать как мы потеряли память и как получили эту амнезию. Для этого нам предстоит проделать тот же путь, что и до потери памяти - на север Зоны. Оказывается во всем виновато Осознание - группа ученых, которая хочет изменить мир. Так, в разговоре с одним из ученых мы узнаем как потеряли память и как получили тату на руке S.T.A.L.K.E.R. , а также как попали в ту труповозку из начала игры. Так как я пошел по истинной концовке (их тут семь, если не ошибаюсь), мне предстояло уничтожить эту группу ученных. После этого мы получаем концовку, в которой Стрелок ложится на траву и задается вопросом, правильно ли он поступил. Раз уж я недавно сказал о концовках игры, то давайте о них и продолжим. Я считаю их первым плюсом этой игры. В игре есть два типа концовок: истинные и неправильные. Сначала о неправильных, их больше всего. Все они завязаны с Исполнителем Желаний. Игра определяет как мы вели себя на протяжении всего прохождения, после чего выдает определенную концовку. Одну из таких концовок я и получил при первом прохождении, тогда я не знал о истинных концовках. Теперь о них и поговорим, их две. В первой, как я и говорил ранее, Стрелок убивает ученых, ну а во второй присоединяется к ним. Вторым плюсом я засчитаю сюжет игры. Мне он очень понравился. В своем обзоре я многого не упомянул. Хоть это не влияет на сюжет игры, но зато дополняет атмосферу игры. Собственно она и является следующим плюсом. Зона полна поджидающих в кустах мутантов и бандитов, полна опасностей и секретов. Она живет своей жизнью. Отряд бандитов может появится просто так, все благодаря движку игры. Песни и анекдоты у костра надолго засели у меня в памяти. Пожалуй все минусы этой игры связаны только с самой реализацией. Первым минусом является BugTrap. Он пострашнее всех мутантов, которых тут можно встретить. Приходится очень часто сохранятся, дабы не проходить огромный кусок игры после появления BugTrapа. Вторым минусом является - ИИ. Он сделан просто ужасно. То противники выходят к тебе спиной, то сидят и смотрят в стену. Как бы, если это играет нам на руку, то бывают и случаи, когда противник играет не по правилам, то через стены начнет стрелять, это без шуток, он просто высовывает дуло через забор-стену и стреляет в нас, то смотря вообще в другую сторону стреляет и попадает в нас. Так, играя на максимальной сложности получаешь больше проблем от аномалий или от перегруза, чем от здешних врагов. Третьим минусом является главная фишка сталкерства. Практически все сталкеры отправляются на Зону, чтобы разбогатеть. Сделать это можно при помощи добычи артефактов. Тут добывать их можно, но все они появляются заскриптованно, то есть только в определенных местах и они будут там всегда, даже после того как вы их подберете, достаточно просто подождать пару игровых часов или же просто перейти с одной локации на другую. В Зове Припяти все было реализовано куда лучше. И последним минусом я посчитаю тайники в этой игре. Сами по себе они хороши, никогда не помешают пара лишних аптечек или припасов. Очень часто я находил тайники и они были просто напросто пустыми, а все потому, что я не убил определенного человек и не получил информацию об этом тайнике из его КПК. Просто представьте себе, что вы самолично, без чьей либо помощи находите клад, но ничего за это не получаете, а все потому что вы не получили об этом кладе никакой информации. Это просто бесит на протяжении всей игры. Первые часов 5 игры все тайники, которые я проверял были пусты, а уже под конец игры, когда я возвращался к ним, там был лут.;320;Моё знакомство, как и у многих, с этой игрой прошло в конце детства - начале подросткового возраста. Первой игрой была не Тень Чернобыля, а Зов Припяти, после прохождения которой, я сразу же бросился проходить и остальные части серии. Как и бывает в таких случаях, когда играешь в игры одной серии в обратном порядке, первое время играть довольно трудно, то игра ощущается не так, то определенной функции нет. Так и было в моем случае.;1. BugTrap. 2. ИИ. 3. Добыча артефактов. 4. Тайники.;6;1. Концовки. 2. Сюжет. 3. Атмосфера.;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl;54105;325193
4041;;A very fun game that ends up feeling half complete. Sure the story finishes but I feel like there are so many plot points and characters that arent fully explored. I was honestly surprised when it became clear I was facing the final boss (even most of the way into the mission, I was expecting more)  Thankfully the gameplay is a fun action game with some unique mechanics and a good soundtrack.

The story is beautifully macabre, the characters beautifully conflicted and the soundtrack is just beautiful. Nothing in NieR is as simple as it seems. This will become apparent when taking on some of the side quests, most of which are simple fetch quests, because there is rarely a happy ending.   The characters are flawed in deep and dark ways but this only serves to make them more interesting. There are different endings for the game where you learn more about the characters youve met, and thankfully for me none are a typical hero story.

4046;;When I was kid, I was amazed and terrified when someone playing Resident Evil. Back in early 00s, I remember Resident Evil (3) was one of game that brought my nightmare with zombies filled my elementary school. The concept of zombie was simpler as monster who will bite your neck and you turn become one of them. And Resident Evil introduced me about zombies and survival in the outbreak in the middle chaos of city as RE3 was the game all about.   Fast forward for two decades, I never play Resident Evil and didnt have time to get invested with storyline, and recently I just played the fourth installment and finished with good impression of game design and the charm of this action-horror game. The game is the major advancement from its predecessor with ps2 graphic with more good character and world building design as the main character need to investigate and fetch an important person in remote village somewhere in Spain.  The element of simple weapon and item upgrade is more attracting to do by shooting the zombies with the limited ammo (that cant be buy) that somehow makes the game is more fun and challenging because they will drop loot like golds to collect and later can be used to buy weapon or upgrade it with random merchant that appear along the way. Every bullets counts, and the game progress has small exploration but its not the major flaw to keep playing since its divided by chapters. It has some tense moments by the swarming enemies to defeat and puzzle session sometimes are frustrating but thank to Internet, by simple google I dont have bother to spend hours to figure it out difficult puzzles.   For the story line itself consist of stand-alone game that is not too much related with predecessor. A just simple handsome policeman went to village, fetching daughter president (how tf she ended up there will be revealed) while players face the residents do evil things (they took the title literally now) and also fight against cult that think need to be saved with virus, sounds cliche for action horror game, and oh wait, that was the final boss said to main character.  Technically, I played on PC for the remaster edition and its working very well without any major bugs or anything else and since this game kinda dated. I dont think this game is unplayable, the graphic and cut scenes are smooth and i just leave the thought that great games need to be polished with fancy graphic. This game proves wrong.   Playing with controller is more recommended even though aiming will be a problem to adjust but the player will understand the game mechanic where usually they need to trigger aiming session before attacking, also the enemy is less aggressive so the chance of running and avoiding damage can be executed. And somehow this game has quick time event in many cut scenes where if player think enjoying the game without aware that they need to push button, it will lead game over because those are so unexpected moment.   RE4 is solid action-horror game with minimizing the game play mechanic but its become the thing will player like because sometimes simplicity is the way to enjoy progressing the game play and also if you think the story-line is cliche, the dialog is more humanized and kind of has touch of make sense;974;;The game is kinda long if players stuck (but still can be played in some session);;Looting zombies Interesting plot with mixed cliche and witty dialogue Upgrading enemies Hunting treasure for grinding;c;38235;325242

I was a bit hesitant about the DLC only because I feel like I rarely experience solid DLC.  I was so wrong about Champions Ballad.  This DLC was amazing.  All of the story beats were great and it was a solid way of explaining how the champions are integrated in the story.  Every champion had a set of quests with shrines.  I looked forward to every single shrine.  They were so creative and felt very rewarding once you solved them.  After you solve all the shrines, there is another divine beast ish dungeon.  That dungeon was such a great wrap up to the DLC.  Without spoiling anything, the only drawbacks I have was that sometimes things felt a bit samey and I thought the end reward would have been a bit more useful.

4050;;Theres a secret 2nd ending to the game if youre on top of the mountain of the final stage, turn on wireframe mode and go to an invisible platform just outside the arena.  Youll be warped back to the arena, sans dinosaurs, while Richard Attenborough (R.I.P.) recites the poem, Ozymandias.  &gt I met a traveller from an antique land &gt Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone &gt Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, &gt Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, &gt And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, &gt Tell that its sculptor well those passions read &gt Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, &gt The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: &gt And on the pedestal these words appear: &gt My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: &gt Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! &gt Nothing beside remains. Round the decay &gt Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare &gt The lone and level sands stretch far away.  I feel like these were put in by the developers as it neared release date, and realizing their game was a going to be released an unpolished, broken mess, put it in as an easter egg.  Because thats what this game is.  A testament to great ambition and hubris, but now a broken and forgotten relic of its time.  Dont get me wrong, this feels like an epic game that would have enjoyed selling millions as a survival exploration game if not for all of the issues.  Its just not a fun game to play.;122573;;The arm.  I hated Surgeon Simulator and this arm is like playing that again.  I have to drop objects just to get through doors and not have stuff like keycards fall through the world.  Physics dont work half the time.  Stuff can get stuck in each other or have weird effects.  Technical issues out the ass.  Seriously, go to Tresscom and get some mods to make sure the games at least half-way works and doesnt crash as much.  You NEED them.  Shooting sucks & cant do melee.  Melee weapons do no damage in the game except for Nedrys mace, so you have to use guns.  (Its so stupid you get the mace near the end of a level and its gone afterwards.)  You have to make sure youre at a distance, properly lined up, and hope your gun doesnt flinch too much from recoil or bump into anything.  The arm makes the game much harder than it should.  Long boring sequences of walking.  If not for the occasional dialogue or raptor, this would be another boring Walking Simulator.  Theres nothing else to do otherwise.  Platforming sucks in general.  Its because of the way Anne moves and how her hitbox was programmed to respond to anything more than a flat surface.  Protip: Bunny hop as much as you can for speed and getting up stairs.  The dinosaurs suck.  Because of the physics attached to their models, any dinosaur and be a compressed sandwich that looks hilariously stupid.  Theyre also super aggressive and will chase you across the map until you kill them.  You have to be careful even around dead raptors because theres a damage stripe inside their models mouth that can kill you.  They also sound nothing like their movie equivalents.  Later levels have less guns.  Good luck getting past the raptors.  The final level is a joke.  The boss sucks, everything falls down the mountain because of the bad AI, and it feels like you dont have enough weapons.  Cant buy it anywhere...  For good reason.  Piracy or one of the rare CD-ROMs are the only way to play.  The source code of the game was given to Tresscom community members some time ago, so not sure if there will be a Source port or anymore fixes.;;Its beautifully atmospheric.  Even with the low poly models and pop-in, the lack of a HUD, limited (beautiful) music, detailed environments and soundscapes immersed me into the game.  Clever puzzles.  Mainly some of the non-keycard doors that require a pass code.  The dinosaurs are scary.  Mostly because the raptors are totally silent until they get right next to you.  If youre not paying attention to the surroundings, youll get pounced and die easily.  The actors are the biggest draw.  Minnie Driver and Richard Attenborough put their full effort into their characters.  Even if people found it grating, listening to them fill in the backstory of the world was not just boring line reads.  The Cray sequence alone should rival Metal Gear Solid, Lucas Arts games, and Legacy of Kain for best acted 90s games.;c;29931;325664
4051;;Welp, the game is just plain bad. Ive written its good and bat points in corresponding fields, so just for the sake of completeness Ill enumerate other aspects which didnt affect the score: character controls are okay, not great, not terrible  GUI is kind of bad-ish, especially multi-item loot windows, but nothing too bad. Sound is fine, though combat themes start to irritate somewhat past first half of the game.;27092;;Dull and extremely politized story unlikeable cardboard characters a joke of a character development mechanic dull and monotonous combat nonlinearity completely independent from character actions. Atmosphere and style, though present, do nothing, just sit there and thats all. No control over party members actions whatsoever, also cant prevent them from sprouting nonsensical combat lines in every combat. The game flow itself is artificially extended at many points through foot travel and lengthy and dull (mini-)boss combat.;;Atmosphere, though passive. Graphics look nice.;c;33098;324623

4053;;Boring game. Although it had positive rating on steam, the game was really boring. The city (environment) is not impressive at all. Fighting is completelly messed up, just press the buttons and batman will do. the skill tree is not clear. The optional missions too many and too messed up. You start to do an optional mission but you cant finish it if you dont get further with the main story. riddler missions too many and too hard. HUD and equipment could be better, only the story was OK.;501;;Fighting system messed up, optional missions too messy and depending on main story, skill tree too messy, HUD lacks;;Story;c;43279;325833
4054;В итоге мы получаем однообразный, коридорный шутер с неполным сюжетом, но зато вызывающий у многих игроков чувство ностальгии проект. Очень надеюсь, что в последующих частях были добавлены новые фишки, которые хоть как то смягчали все это однообразие.;Мы играем за Крутого Сэма, последнюю надежду Земли. На человечество совершаются нападения со стороны пришельцев из другого измерения. Земляне теряли систему за системой до тех пор, пока у них не осталась лишь Солнечная система. И теперь у человечества появилась возможность, благодаря найденным древним технологиям, отправить одного человека в прошлое и остановить вторжение. Так как Сэм был у всех на слуху и никогда не проигрывал пришельцам, было решено отправить в прошлое его. После чего нас ожидает до невозможности однообразный геймплей. Мы будем собирать разные штукенции, которые пригодятся нам по ходу игры, а все остальное время - будем убивать. Чем дольше мы играем, тем больше будет противников. Так, на первых уровнях будет всего 100-300 врагов, а ближе к финалу 600-800, причем количество противников зависит от сложности на которой вы играете. Это и есть первый минус - однообразность. К сожалению, сюжет тут не полон, так как в конце игры нам сообщают, что продолжение следует. Поэтому сюжет ни к плюсам, ни к минусам относить не буду, ведь я его полностью еще не познал. У многих геймеров эта игра вызывает ностальгию, но мне она ничего предложить не может, кроме кучи врагов. Пожалуй, единственным плюсом можно засчитать большой арсенал главного героя. Прямо сейчас, во время написания обзора меня преследует ощущение, что у этой игры нет плюсов, да и минусов тоже нет, кроме тех, которые я описал выше. Обычно видя финальные титры игрок получает наслаждение от того, что он прошел игру, но после этой игры такого ощущения нет. К плюсам можно было бы приписать шутки Сэма, но в игре их немного. Пожалуй оставим все как есть, вскоре я начну проходить The Second Encounter, может там будут хоть какие-нибудь нововведения, которые смогли бы разнообразить игровой процесс.;857;У многих геймеров знакомство с этой игрой прошло еще в детстве. С самим Сэмом я познакомился в возрасте 12 лет, примерно, но первой игрой был не The First Encounter, а вторая часть. Пройти его я тогда не пытался, просто бегал по локациям и убивал врагов, в сюжет не вникал. Но вот прошло довольно много времени и я решил начать проходить игры о Крутом Сэме. Решил я сделать это не вовремя. Во время отъезда я начал проходить первую часть, но из за постоянной занятости я его так и не прошел. Только спустя 3-4 месяца я взялся за него вновь.;1.

4055;;The game has a really nice story and plot. Gameplay is fine, stealth in first-person, nice skills and equipment. Graphics could be a bit better and some unlockables after completing the game could give extra motivation to playthrough the game again. However it was a very nice experience in total.

4056;;The gameplay of Half-Life consists out of three things: shooting, environmental puzzles and platforming. The shooting is alright: a couple of unique weapons, but the enemy AI is bad, they shoot with pinpoint accuracy and take too many hits to kill. I found the environmental puzzles to be quite frustrating, because they are just not intuitive and they always have only one solution. Though, I really didnt enjoy the platforming. I wouldnt have been able to complete the game without the step by step walkthrough of the YouTuber BigMacDavis.;231;;- Outdated enemy gameplay - Frustrating environmental puzzles - Awful platforming;;- Awesome how all of the rooms are connected to previous areas - Good environmental story telling - Quite diverse enemies;c;35434;325859

4058;В итоге, мы получаем необычную игру-головоломку. Если вы до сих пор по каким либо причинам не сыграли в нее, то советую сделать это прямо сейчас.;Сюжет в этой игре не имеет большого значения, но все же, для полноты картины расскажу. Мы играем за напарника, или же за друга какого-то наблюдателя, который решил отойти ненадолго, оставив нас за главного. Перед выходом он попросил ничего не трогать. Вот и весь сюжет. В игре есть, если не ошибаюсь, 25 концовок. Некоторые из них довольно просты, а над некоторыми придется идти в гугл, чтобы понять, что от тебя требуют. В игре полным полно отсылок к каким либо фильмам, мультфильмам и ко многому другому. Тут даже есть отсылка на Футураму. Неожиданным повортом событий был выход из игры. Я имею ввиду, после получения одной из концовок игра сама закрылась.Из плюсов я хотел бы отметить: звуковое сопровождение, сложные головоломки и отсылки. Ну а минусов тут нет, вот такая это хорошая игра.;9327;Как и со многими играми, с этой я познакомился благодаря Куплинову. Я с огромным интересом смотрел его прохождение этой странной, полной загадок игры. И вот, пришло время сыграть самому.;-;6;1. Сложные головоломки. 2. Звуковое сопровождение. 3. Отсылки.;Please, Dont Touch Anything;54105;325901
4059;Торт - это ложь.;Мы играем за подопытную, которой предстоит пройти 19 камер испытаний. Проходить мы будем эти камеры с помощью портальной пушки. Поначалу мы можем стрелять лишь одним порталом, но через несколько уровней нам дадут модифицированную версию пушки с двумя порталами. Игра находится во вселенной Half-Life и является спин-оффом, я надеялся найти тут отсылки к халве, но ничего не заметил, может во второй части будет хоть что-то. Единственной схожестью я могу засчитать пушку, ведь у Гордона есть грави пушка, которая выглядит примерно так же. После того как мы пройдем все камеры испытаний ГладОС, искусственный интеллект, который все это время наблюдал за нами, попытается убить нас, сделать это у нее не получится, ведь мы сбежим и финальной схватке одолеем ее. Концовка у игры была сделана с завязкой на продолжение, нас утаскивает какой-то робот. Теперь поговорим о плюсах и минусах этой игры. Первый плюс - это ее разнообразность. Все благодаря наращиванию сложности испытательных камер. Чем дальше мы идем - тем сложнее нам становится. Вторым плюсом я засчитаю головоломки, они были сделаны тут очень хорошо. Третий плюс - это фразы ГладОС. Хоть она и является нашим врагом, таковой не ощущается. Мне и многим геймерам она запомнилась благодаря своим фразочкам и шуткам. Минусов в этой игре нет. Игра была сделана с душой, именно поэтому она и понравилась тысячам геймеров.;71;Мое знакомство с игрой прошло в те времена, когда я только начинал пользоваться Steamом, а это был 2017 год. Вот так поздно я приобщился ко всем этим лаунчерам. Помню, что игру покупал я по скидке. Уже тогда я не раз слышал, что эта игра - шедевр игровой индустрии, собственно я и решил это проверить.;-;6;1.

4060;;It was potentially a great game. Great setting, okay graphics style, looked really promising. However, what came out in the end looks kind of half-baked classic Fallout knock-off in lovecraftian setting, riddled with NUMEROUS bugs even though this is a release.

4062;;The general message and story development are important. Besides that, this is merely one of those investigation novels, where you jump off to different pages depending on your decision how to proceed. The only gameplay element in the end is to drag and drop automatically highlighted lines of text to their corresponding persons profil. It even tells you which remarks will interfere with others. Other than that, you will spend 90% of gametime reading the other 95% of sources, which draw the settings framework, but are not part of proceeding to the next stage. In terms of replay value: There is no fastforward of the live chat and phonecall protocols - very tedious and time consuming. I left the game running for 5 minutes and emptied the dish washer...That much fun it was to go for 100% achievements.;22704;;no real gameplay elements no voice over reading lines and lines of mediocrely written webpage material;6;Interesting and important storyline which sends a message;c;1167;325943
4095;;The Swapper is a puzzle game, not a platformer (as it might seem from pictures or videos). That said, it uses a very simple game mechanic (making clones of yourself), and reinvents it several times throughout the game.

4096;В итоге мы получаем хлипкую новеллу. Казалось бы, можно было бы добавить больше диалогов, больше вариантов развития событий, но разработчик не соизволил поработать над своим проектом.;История рассказывает нам об одном программисте, который нашел диск с игрой. Он достался ему от прошлого владельца помещения. На диске была визуальная новелла, после парочки вопросов к главному герою она (ИИ игры) сообщает нам о том, что ей надо собрать больше информации. После чего игра попадает в интернет. Игру начали скачивать, более того, она стала самой популярной в мире. В игре есть несколько концовок. Я знаю всего о двух, может есть и больше. В первой, плохой концовке ИИ интеллект становится плохой и уничтожает человечество. А во второй, хорошей она преклоняет колено перед человечеством и обещает служить во благо. Это был первый плюс игры - концовки. Единственным минусом я засчитаю реализацию игры: в ней мало вариантов развития событий, а также она очень короткая.;107442;Познакомился я с этой игрой благодаря рекомендациям Steam. Мне стало интересно, смогу ли я развить ИИ до необычайных высот. Плюс ко всему этому игра стоила всего рублей 15, поэтому, почему бы не попробовать.;1. Реализация;6;1. Концовки.;I ♥ You!;54105;326482
4097;В итоге мы получаем еще одну игру во вселенной Rusty Lake, с небольшим количеством головоломок, вышедшую на мобильные устройства.;В названии говорится о коробке Харви, из нее нам предстоит сбежать. Тут мы можем встретить уже знакомых нам персонажей - Ворона и Голубя. Очень радуют разработчики своими запутанными загадками, это несомненно плюс этой игры. Также очень порадовал скример в конце игры, было неожиданно его там встретить, хоть он и не напугал.;75126;Открыл для себя эту игру я сам. После прохождения первой части Rusty Lake, я решил поискать другие игры от этого разработчика. Я узнал, что он делает игры не только для браузера, не только для компьютера, но и для мобильных устройств. Первой игрой в которую я хотел сыграть на мобильном устройстве была Cube Escape: Seasons, но она почему то напросто не открывалась. Поэтому я решил сыграть в другую, первую попавшуюся, и это была она.;-;34;1. Головоломки. 2. Скример.;Cube Escape: Harveys Box;54105;326549
4098;В итоге мы получаем годную игру. P.S. Тут есть режим игры одной рукой (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).;Особого сюжета тут нет. Мы просто играем за чувака, который листает что-то вроде Tinderа и ищет себе девушек. После чего начинается основной геймплей игры. Мы катаемся на мотоцикле и уничтожаем одежду девушки, в игре также есть nude патч (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Также мы можем выбрать способности нашего мотоцикла, также его темп стрельбы.;36977;Познакомился я с этой игрой благодаря рекомендациям Steam, и не пожалел, игра действительно хороша (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).;-;6;1.

4099;В итоге мы получаем красивую пиксельную игру, с очень сложным сюжетом, и с очень сложным геймплеем.;Вообще сюжет у Hotline Miami очень сложный и запутанный. Мы даже не знаем имя главного героя, но все называют его Джекет. Скорее всего это из за его куртки. Я вам сейчас поведаю сюжет, уже распутанный, дабы вы его хотя бы примерно поняли. Джекет находится  в коме, у него видения о не так давно прошедших событиях. Каким то образом он вступил в организацию 50 Благословений. Организация эта боролась с русской мафией. Делала она это с помощью звонков на телефон, и с помощью запутанных сообщений отправляла людей на убийство мафиози. Одним из убийц и был Джекет. Так, он разобрался с главой мафии - Отцом, после чего убил и отца Отца :D. На этом и закончилась история Джекета в Hotline Miami. Он вышел на балкон и закурил сигару. Титры. Но это еще не все, после этого нам показывают историю Байкера - одну из жертв Джекета. В ходе этой истории Байкер каким-то образом выжил, но скорее всего это было сделано, чтобы довести рассказ до конца, а так, на деле он мертв. Этот сюжет и есть первый плюс игры. Вторым плюсом я засчитаю хардкорность игры. Минусов нет - это шедевр.;1384;Знакомство с игрой у меня прошло уже после выхода второй части Hotline Miami. В те времена я активно смотрел видео с ТОПами игр для слабых ПК. Ну конечно же обе части входили в такие ТОПы. Спустя какое-то время я купил себе обе части и тут понеслось.;-;6;1. Сюжет. 2.

4101;В итоге мы получаем лучшую версию Теней Чернобыля с новыми локациями, предысторией основной игры, большим арсеналом оружия, поиском артефактов, войной группировок, модификациями оружия и многими другими плюшками этой игры.;Нам рассказывается история Шрама - человека, который остановил Стрелка. Как мы помним, Стрелок по сюжету Теней Чернобыля попал в грузовик смерти, а как он туда попал, нам не говорят. Чистое Небо это предыстория к Теням Чернобыля. Шрам - наёмник, который пережил два выброса и был найден группировкой Чистое Небо. Дабы не затягивать обзор, расскажу вкратце. После того, как Шрам очнулся на базе Чистого Неба, он узнал о том, что некий Стрелок пытается пробраться в Центр Зоны, из за этого происходят частые выбросы. Чистому Небу и Шраму надо это прекратить, на кону стоит множество жизней. Так и начинается наша погоня за Стрелком, мы будем переходить из локации в локации, все ближе к Центру Зоны. Когда мы все же до него доберемся, нам предстоит уничтожить его пси защиту. После этого происходит мощнейший выброс, в ходе которого по всей видимости погибает начальство Чистого Неба. Нам показывают Стрелка который не может двигаться, вот так на него подействовал выброс. Ну а с Шрамом что-то случилось, из за чего выбросы действуют на него не так сильно. Он начинает осматриваться и видит темный коридор, в котором куча сталкеров, в том числе и Стрелок. Титры. Это и был первый плюс - сюжет. На самом деле в игре еще много интересных вещей, так была добавлена война группировок. Задумка интересная, но реализация ужасна. Вся война сводится к захвату опорных точек противника, последней точкой является база врага. Так, начиная войну за Сталкеров Одиночек против Бандитов, в связи с багом войну завершить невозможно. Для захвата точки, необходимо, чтобы на нее пришли дружественные войска, вот только на базу Бандитов Одиночки не идут. Поэтому Бандиты просто постоянно там спавнятся и этим не дают завершить войну. Или же ситуация между Долгом и Свободой. После захвата базы Долга, я заметил, что они просто отспавнились в главном здании. Нормально, да? Это и есть первый минус - баги. И это лишь мелкая их часть. Но с другой стороны, война группировок - это плюс, мне было очень интересно отбивать контратаки Долга и штурмовать базу Бандитов, это было круто. Третьим плюсом является поиск артефактов. По сравнению с первой частью, где артефакты просто лежали на определенных местах, тут их надо искать с помощью детектора в определенных местах. Четвертым плюсом является большой арсенал. По сравнению с первой частью было добавлено много новых пушек. Пятый плюс - модификация оружия и брони. Теперь у мастеров можно починить сломанное оружие / броню, а также улучшить их. По сравнению с первой частью, где улучшенное оружие можно было только найти где-нибудь - это огромный плюс. Шестой плюс - быстрые перемещения. Ну серьезно, куда без них.;4840;Знакомство с Чистым небом произошло в последнюю очередь, после Теней Чернобыля и Зова Припяти.

4102;В итоге мы получаем классическую игру о Второй Мировой войне.;Особого сюжета нет, как практически во всех играх про Вторую Мировую. Нас ожидает шесть разнообразных миссий. То мы играем по стелсу, то мы рашим противника всеми силами, то мы ездим на грузовике, то на поезде, короче разнообразие тут есть и это первый плюс. Вторым плюсом я засчитаю красиво поставленные экшн сцены. Кто проходил игру, тот поймет. Ну и самым главным плюсом, пожалуй, я засчитаю вариативность, хоть она тут не выделена, но все же она есть. Нас никто не ограничивает. Хотите пройти стелсовую миссию штурмом? Да пожалуйста, главное пройдите. Минусов я не заметил.;326;Знакомство с игрой произошло у меня еще в детстве. После прохождения Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare и Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 мне подарили установочный диск с этой игрой.

4103;I would recommend checking out Yonder:  The Cloud Catcher Chronicles if you are looking for a nice, chill experience with little stress.;This weekend I wanted to play a game where I could chill out.  Something that wasnt stressful but was an escape from reality.  This game scratched that itch.  It starts you out in a small region but soon you unlock other biomes.  The world starts slowly opening up, more and more.  The best part about this was that the world felt large enough to feel different but not large enough to where traversing was a labor.  The side quests and main quests were never boring but werent challenging either.  They were simple yet satisfying.  The story was predictable but in a way it was nice to have something presented that was predictable.  Story/Gameplay aside the graphics were great.

4105;;Played the PC Windows version on Steam.  GTA IV is a good game overall, aside from the horrendous optimization problems this game has over the years Ive tried to make this game run with different setups.  You play as Niko Bellic who just landed in the lands of opportunity by boat, bringing with him his troubled past and a reason to go somewhere else to make a living.  The game is pretty straightforward if you have played any other GTA games. What separate this and the previous ones is what I feel is that the atmosphere within the story is more gritty, yet retains its usual crazyness from previous titles. The game has overall a lot of improvements but also some of the extra activities from previous games are to be missing in this title, which makes play time outside missions a bit stale sometimes. A solution to this is the friend system, which is well implemented except for the fact that you have to baby sit them during the day so they dont get grumpy, and disliking you.  I recommend playing this game but be warned with the hardware setup if playing on new PCs that it was not designed for. The game also still has Games for Windows Live for saving and online play, but you can easily create an offline account and save from there.;731;;- Runs like garbage or unstable if you dont have the right hardware setup (too high-end). - Too little activities outside of story missions. - Friends are needy. - Poor optimization.;6;- Story is good and a bit different compared to previous games with more focus on characters. - Activities and side-missions that made it from the previous games improved and not as monotonous. - Friend system.;c;39973;326688

4109;;This is a great little strategy game that will give you hours of enjoyment. However, its a bit difficulty to get into, because there isnt a proper tutorial (just hints). Chapter 9 is also incredibly hard, compared to the other chapters. Lastly, the devs have seemed to stop developing the game (1+ year since the last update). This isnt a huge issue, since the game is quite polished (aside from the points mentioned). Also, did I mention that the game is currently free?;57549;;- Proper tutorial needs to be added - Chapter 9 is way too difficult;;- Great art and music - Interesting gameplay - Great difficulty (ex chapter 9);c;35434;326580
4110;;God of War 2018 is not a bad game. I simpy am dissapointed by how they made a game which seems to be ashamed of its predecessors. It has so many things that a God of War game doesnt need and so little of what made the other games so good.  In a way, GoW18 is a high above average product, as it shows in its audiovisual polish and its scope and the effort put into writing and such. In todays gaming industry , these things arent to be taken as a given at all. But in another way, this game is completely average, namely in its game design choices which follow boring contemporary trends. I tried it two times, with plenty of time inbetween to accept the changes and try it again in an unbiased way. I never got past the three-hour-mark. The combat feels powerful enough, but is destroyed by health-sponge enemies and an utterly fucked up camera perspective (which needs a ridiculous red danger indicator for incoming attacks from behind). Spatial traversal feels painfully slow and boring. Kratos climbs only predetermined paths by simply pressing forward and cannot jump, so that rules any meaningful movement out. And, maybe the worst thing, the pacing as a whole is destroyed by  completely half-assed RPG mechanics, an open world that feels oddly misplaced, and overall filler-y Puzzles and (recycled) boss fights.  The story seemed alright to me. But yeah, theres not so much God of War left in this.;19560;;anything that involves gameplay feels slow and boring;;great production value;c;55604;327058
4111;;Awful. EA promised us new features in career mode after several years, but when you start playing you notice that the new features are broken and that they even broke other, already existing functionality that are important to the core gameplay.

4112;В итоге мы получаем полный перестрелок, драк, кровищи шедевр, который запомнился многим геймерам благодаря своей сложности.;Сюжет во второй части идёт вразброс. От этого, и без того сложный для понимания сюжет стал еще сложнее. К сожалению, история Джекета здесь будет рассказана не от его лица, так что сыграть за него мы не сможем. Как мы помним, Джекет убил Отца и его отца. После чего его повязали полицейские и посадили в тюрягу, больше о нем упоминаний нет, только в самом конце игры. После того, что натворил наш главный герой в первой части, у него появились подражатели. Некая группировка Фанаты, она, как и Джекет брала задания по телефону, носила маски, и убивала русскую мафию. По сюжету главарем мафии стал сын Отца, отсюда и его имя Сын. Теперь группировке Фанаты предстоит уничтожить его. Незадолго до этого Сын употребил слишком много наркотиков, из за чего у него были видения, поэтому он видел не убийц в масках животных, а самих животных (речь идет о Фанатах). Фанаты не рассчитали свои силы и в ходе перестрелки все погибли. Мне сильнее всего было жалко Тони (тигр), хотя все они крутые персонажи. После чего Сын вышел на крышу и пошел по радужному мосту, который ему привиделся. На самом же деле никакого моста не было и он просто упал с крыши. Вообще по всему Майами было множество убийств, так, одной из жертв стал президент СССР. Это и послужило причиной сброса атомной бомбы на Америку. В ходе взрыва погиб даже сам Джекет, который спокойно отсиживал свой срок в тюряге. Так и закончилась история Hotline Miami. Из плюсов я выделю все такой же офигенный сюжет, крутых персонажей, четкую музыку. Минусов нет.;2126;Как я говорил в своем обзоре по первой части, покупал я сразу две части Hotline Miami, поэтому после прохождения первой сразу принялся за вторую.;-;6;1. Сюжет. 2.

4113;;Very poor all around. Not much improved in Career mode bar a few new cutscenes. Volta football is a very promising addition to the game I must say and I love the amount of customisation, however there is a lot of bugs. I played a couple of tournaments and every single game was against my own team. Its a pitty because I do like the potential it had. Also for Volta the story is bland and predictable, celebrations are embarassing and the gameplay is much like a regular fifa match with a smaller pitch.   Then comes the UI. I dont know who was the designer for the interface but its absolutely dreadful. Customising your character is the most painful experience I have ever had to deal with. The layout is horrific and you struggle to find a lot of settings when creating your character. Im serous when I ask was this even play tested?? The visual design for the menus are completely fine but whos idea was it to completely change it for character customisation? If you want an example of the little effort EA have put into this game, this says it all. Also a small detail that annoyed me was the youth academy players when promoted have all the exact same shirts again, unlike last year when they were all different colours and gave them a bit more character.  Ultimate team is the same money-grabbing, microtransaction infested game mode as usual.   As for the gameplay, its almost as if EA wanted you to play badly. The passing is completely broken and constantly passes to the wrong player. If you havent broken your controller after the first day of playing, youre doing very well. The first touch system when getting the ball is also dreadful, along with many more flaws.   Everything about this game compares to a college project that was semi-completed on the day before it was due.;114287;;Bugs with Volta. Nothing improved in Career Mode. Terrible UI and UX design.

4116;Браво, разработчики, вы сделали игру, которая побила рекорды по скачиваниям, но при этом из своего добавили только текстуры. Все остальное было взято из других проектов.;Вообще поначалу мне нравилась эта игра, но стоило мне разобрать ее, как интерес к ней пропадает. В игре есть несколько уже доступных режимов многопользовательской игры, а также есть анонсированные, но не добавленные (зомби режим, к примеру). Первый режим - это обычный бой до тех пор, пока какая либо команда не наберет определенное количество очков. Второй режим - захват точек и набор очков. Третий режим - королевская битва. Четвертый режим - перестрелка, с постоянно меняющимся оружием. Пятый режим - каждый сам за себя. Казалось бы, все в порядке, но нет. Call Of Duty: Mobile не привнесла абсолютно ничего нового. Первые два режима были наверное во всех играх Call Of Duty, кроме первых парочки частей (в Modern Warfare 100% были такие режимы). Королевская битва по функционалу была скопирована с PUBG Mobile, некоторые фишки, возможно были взяты из других игр (тоже королевских битв). По визуалу (интерфейс и т.п.) она мне напомнила Apex Legends. Перестрелка, четвертый режим, был как минимум в Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Там также надо было убивать противников, за убийства давали новое оружие, последним из которых был нож. Каждый сам за себя тоже не оригинальный режим, даже в том же самом Counter Strike есть такой режим, вот только называется он чуть по другому. Зомби режим, который вот вот выйдет также уже был в играх Call Of Duty, а именно: World At War, Black Ops, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3, Black Ops 4. Раз уж речь зашла про Black Ops 4, то можно сказать, что он является королевской битвой. Получается у Call Of Duty: Mobile вообще нет никакой оригинальности. В первую неделю за заход  в игру давали разные скины, и другие интересные плюшки. Последней наградой на неделе был скин на оперативника. У меня в 7 день недели встал вопрос: Будет ли на следующей неделе новый оперативник, или еще что покруче?, но нет, на следующий день, зайдя в игру я увидел в списке наград лишь кредиты и сундуки. Это очень печально, ведь кредиты вообще нафиг не нужны. На них можно купить лишь скины или же граффити. Все предметы которые можно купить на кредиты легко помещаются на двух с половиной строчках в магазине. Это ведет нас к следующей проблеме игры - ориентированности на донаты. Самый дорогой пак денег будет стоить 7 тысяч рублей. Вы, блин серьезно? 7 тысяч за виртуальные деньги, на которые ничего кроме скинов не купишь?! Также в игре есть боевой пропуск, куда же без него? Ведь в других играх он тоже есть (PUBG), значит и в Call Of Duty надо добавить. Как и в остальных играх есть два боевых пропуска: платный и бесплатный. То есть вы понимаете? В этом огрызке нет ничего своего, кроме текстурок. Плюс она еще и плохо оптимизирована. Так, в королевскую битву в первые дни я играл, все было хорошо, но после какого-то обновления игра стала просто сворачиваться, без возможности развернуться, поможет только перезапуск.;106805;Познакомился я с этой игрой благодаря такому каналу на YouTube, как Specter. Как то раз он проподил стрим по Modern Warfare 2 и мне он выпал в рекомендациях. Я подписался и спустя некоторое время у него на канале вышел ролик о Call Of Duty: Mobile, я тут же хотел ее скачать, но не тут то было, можно было лишь зарегистрироваться на бета тест, чтобы потом, некоторые из зарегистрированных смогли потестить игру. К сожалению я не бета тестер. Но вот спустя несколько месяцев, игра вышла. Я ее качнул уже на второй день после релиза. А теперь я вам расскажу о самой игре и о всем, что мне известно.;1. Отсутствие оригинальности. 2. Донат. 3. Ненужная игровая валюта. 4. Плохая оптимизация.;34;-;Call of Duty: Mobile;54105;327362

4118;Собственно, вот и весь обзор, впереди меня ждут еще несколько частей в серии Rusty Lake, около 5-7 частей.;Как и в остальных частях серии Rusty Lake, тут очень сильно запутанный сюжет. Понять его мне уже вряд ли удастся. Эта игра выполнена все в том же стиле, как и остальные игры в серии. Поэтому из плюсов сразу можно выделить ее головоломки. Seasons, кстати, она называется не просто так. Нам предстоит пройти четыре времени года. Они все представлены в виде отдельных глав. Минусов тут нет.;75092;Очередная игра в серии Cube Escape, найденная мной на просторах Play Маркета. Впервые я узнал о ней благодаря IGDB.;-;34;1. Головоломки.;Cube Escape: Seasons;54105;327403
4119;Пожалуй на этом все, вот такая крутая первая пройденная мной игра.;Так как дядя уходил на учебу, я просил у него включить компьютер, чтобы я сыграл во что нибудь. На экране компьютера выделялся ярлык этой игры, так я и начал свой геймерский путь. Я очень долго не мог пройти миссию с кораблем. Когда начинается потом, нам необходимо бежать, в те времена я еще плохо разбирался в сторонах, я не знал где лево, а где право, поэтому, во время побега, когда Прайс кричал : Направо, направо!, я терялся и умирал. У моей тети учеба заканчивалась чуть раньше, поэтому она пришла домой и помогла мне пройти эту миссию. Вторым таким же запоминающимся случаем было то, что случилось со мной на миссии Жара. По сюжету нам надо отступить к амбару и взять там джавелин, чтобы уничтожить танки противника. Но дело в том, что я не знал, что такое амбар. Я ходил около него, но не понимал, что туда надо зайти. И продолжалось бы это еще долго, если бы я не зашел туда случайно и не увидел светящийся желтым цветом джавелин. Так как для меня игра на компьютере была в новинку, я проходил каждый день может одну миссию, иногда две, если успевал. Сейчас же я смог пройти всю  игру ровно за три часа. А теперь, дабы этот текст стал обзором, надо поговорить о плюсах и минусах игры. Первый плюс - это сюжет. Он тут довольно таки интересный, по сравнению с предыдущими частями Call Of Duty, еще круто то, что в линейке Modern Warfare учтены мелочи, так, водитель машины, который везет президента на казнь, оказался Макаровым, об это можно будет узнать позже. А также и другие сюжетные проблески будут заполнены в следующих частях этой линейки. Второй плюс, уже встречался в предыдущих частях, и это удобство стрельбы. На днях я сыграл в PUBG, и был удивлен тем, насколько там неудобная стрельба. Тут же делать это приятно. Третий плюс - это персонажи. В моей памяти на долго отложился Капитан Прайс, Соуп, Гас и Григгс.;623;Это первая пройденная мной игра. В те времена у меня не было компьютера, мне было лет шесть может, и я играл у своего дяди, пока он был на учебе.

4120;В итоге мы получаем неплохую, короткую инди игру, выполненную в графическом стиле Amanita Design.;Эта игра из разряда, в которой мы играем непонятно за кого. Вроде как главного героя зовут Гомо, вот только что он такое. Вообще он похож на тряпичную куклу, но в том является ли он ею, я не уверен. Завязка игры схожа с  завязкой Machinariuma только тут похитили собаку главного героя. Он встретился с какими то пришельцами, которые собираются отдать нам собаку обратно, но при условии того, что мы достанем им красный кристалл. В конце концов собака будет спасена и она с главным героем вернутся домой. В игре полным полно разных мини игр и головоломок. Это и есть первый и второй плюсы - головоломки и разнообразие геймплея. Пожалуй это и есть все ее плюсы, минусов тут нет.;7552;Открыл для себя я эту игру на одной из распродаж Steam, не помню точно за сколько я ее себе взял, но точно знаю, что стоила она дешево. По графическому стилю она напомнила мне Machinarium, возможно это и есть главная причина, почему я ее купил.;-;6;1. Головоломки. 2. Разнообразие геймплея.;Gomo;54105;327405
4121;;GTA 4 is somewhat different from its predecessors. A big graphical jump from the previous versions of GTA is visible and shows how much hardware changed over the years. The creators decided to go with a more realistic approach (for instance, if you crash driving with very high speed, you will literally fly from the vehicle). This makes the game feel less arcade-y, however, it is not as much fun anymore (getting into the car animation takes forever). The way you have to do the missions is more scripted and allows for less player freedom. I much more prefer the unrealistic sandbox feel of the previous versions. The game can be equally frustrating, though. Great story, characters to identify with, player choice (to kill/not to kill), fun missions are all a reason to give GTA 4 a chance.;731;;More realistic approach to the world design No mission checkpoints Frustrating controls Less freedom in missions;;Story Characters Its GTA Incredibly addicting and fun;c;47814;282528
4122;В итоге, мы получаем самую проработанную игру про сталкерство, тут и добычу артефактов реализовали наилучшим образом, короче все сделали только лучше. По моему мнению, это лучшая часть в серии.;Главный герой сменился, снова, теперь мы играем за Дегтярева. Сюжет игры происходит после событий Тени Чернобыля. Дегтярева отправили на Зону, чтобы узнать причины крушения вертолетов, которые пролетали над Зоной. Позже выяснится, что случилось все это из за выброса, аномалии сменили свои места, это было не учтено, поэтому и произошло крушение. В игре есть всего 3 локации. Затон, Окрестности Юпитера и Припять. Ввиду того, что выживших нет, Дегтяреву надо было выбираться, вот только сделать это не так просто. Выбраться можно из точек эвакуации, а единственная активная находится в Припяти. Все было бы хорошо, вот только тоннель, ведущий туда замурован и заполнен газом. Дегтярев собирает себе отряд и с ним перебирается в Припять. Со временем, он, со своими сослуживцами, которых он встретил в Припяти, улавливают сигнал, находится он под землей и движется на нашу базу. Оказывается, это Стрелок. Он выбрался и пришел сюда. Стрелок готов поделится информацией, которая способна помочь уничтожить Зону. Поначалу начальство не собиралось отправлять эвакуационный вертолет за Дегтяревым и остальными, но когда узнало о Стрелке, то сразу же направило вертолет. Дегтярев и остальные выбрались из Зоны, а знания Стрелка помогают в изучении Зоны. Вообще в игре очень много разных концовок. Каждая концовка складывается из варианта прохождения различных квестов. Чем больше квестов выполнишь, тем лучше будет концовка. К примеру, я выполнил все квесты и получил наилучшую концовку. Первые два плюса - это сюжет и концовки. Третий плюс - это возможность модернизации оружия. По сравнению с Чистым Небом, она стала лучше. Пожалуй единственным минусом будут баги. Их тут не прям много, но они все же есть. Сейчас я расскажу о самых ярких багах, которые у меня были в процессе прохождения. Первый - это баг, при котором все вольные сталкеры становились противниками, даже сюжетные персонажи, хотя я всегда сталкерам помогал, не стрелял по ним, просто они взяли и стали противниками. С этим багом было бы невозможно пройти игру. Но как все началось с бага, так им и закончилось, после того как я перезашел в игру, со временем, все прошло. Второй баг, это баг, при котором НПС невосприимчивы к мутантам. К примеру, на станции Янов, вокруг двора бегало две стаи собак, ни Свободовцы, ни Долговцы не стреляли по мутантам, а просто стояли рядом. Или же уже в Припяти, собаки напали на Вано и еще одного напарника, не помню как его зовут (военный),  а они стоят и не атакуют врага, в то время как те во всю бьют и меня и их.;7605;Это первая часть в серии S.T.A.L.K.E.R., в которую я сыграл. После ее первого прохождения, я решил пройти предшествующие ей части, но как я заметил играть в них было не настолько удобно как в Зов Припяти.;1. Баги.;6;1. Сюжет. 2. Концовки. 3.

4123;;God of War is the story of a man and his son on a journey to lay his recently passed wife to rest. It is difficult to convey just how beautiful, powerful, and amazingly crafted this masterpiece of a game is.  Story  God of War, technically the 4th mainline title in the series, takes place long after the ending of God of War 3 and acts as both a continuation of the story and a reimagining of the series. What used to be a non-stop, hate filled, machine of a series has been completely reintroduced as a meticulous, well thought out, journey highlighting the dynamics of the life of a god and the overall growth of a family. As this is a reimagining in the series, the developers have taken the time to briefly cover the information critical to the story, removing any need to play the previous entries prior to this one. What they managed to achieve with this change is nothing short of a miracle, deserving of every single award it has received in the time after its release. There are a couple of times where the tone of the characters felt odd, but these instances were few and far between as well as not terribly impactful. Overall, God of War provides possibly best crafted story in an action game to date and from now on will be all that I think of when I hear the phrase “life is a journey, not a destination”.  Gameplay  The standard cycle of gameplay jumps between fast paced hack and slash sections and slower paced puzzle sections. The combat feels relatively reserved early into the game. However, as you progress, it becomes more and more extreme, adding new weapons, combos, and flashy finishers. It generally feels somewhat difficult, but fair. My only gripe is that there never really feels like there is much punishment for dying. The shorter fights don’t take long to get through or move you very far back when you die, and the longer fights checkpoint you at each major interval. The puzzles are very simple for the most part, there were only a couple of points in the game where I had to stop for a moment and think of a way to get past a section. The developers did manage to get creative with the structures of some of the puzzles given that the tools to use in the game are limited. Spliced between the combat and puzzles, there are cutscene sections and associated quick time events. These sections are beautiful, very well designed, and don’t go overboard on the quick time events like they did in some of the previous entries. Frequently, these are tied directly into major boss fights and don’t interrupt the flow of battle as badly as one may expect from a cutscene/quick time event.  The customization and the progression in the game centers around the three primary weapons and an array of defensive accessories. As the player progresses through God of War, they are presented with equipment, currency, and resources. The equipment is often not as impactful as what you can purchase in the store (in-game currency of course, nothing paid), but is fun to find around anyways. The currency can be used to purchase items, resources, and equipment in the store, upgrade equipment from the store, or to be turned into resources directly. I never felt terribly limited by the amount of currency I was receiving throughout the game as it scales directly with your progression in the game. Finally, the resources can be used along with the currency to upgrade equipment in the shop. The high tier resources are difficult to come by and generally are found from major bosses and the lower tier resources are found frequently from standard enemies.  End game content is satisfying, but tedious at times. With a bulk of the content being collectables or grinding for Mist (an end game resource), the gameplay quickly loses its charm. So, I would personally recommend beating the game, but not necessarily going for the platinum as it’s going to be a slog of looking for collectables. The moment to moment combat in the end game is as satisfying as it is in the early game, so if you just want more combat, feel free to go for the completion or reaching for some of the post-game content.  Art  Every single area in God of War feels detailed, fleshed out, and fun to experience. Although there is an overall feeling of “cold winter” in all the areas, each one feels unique and fun to explore. The skyboxes are well detailed, the character models are all extremely beautiful and don’t feel out of place, and the equipment feels unique and well designed. Many times, I found myself gliding along the lake in the canoe and looking out into the distance at the monstrous figures and mountains just to take in the beauty of the game.  Controls  The controls are nothing special, but there is something to be said about figuring out a way to let a player control two different characters at once relatively fluidly. At times I found myself accidently putting away my weapons, switching weapons, or activating rage mode during battle, but other than those rare moments, things were generally smooth. The controls for Atreus, while difficult to memorize right off the bat, felt very easy to execute in the endgame (albeit a bit button mash-y).  Sound  Overall, the developers knocked the sound design out of the park in God of War. The voice acting is amazing to say the least. The conversations between the characters are engaging, entertaining, and just fun to experience through the entire game. The in-battle banter is smooth and enjoyable. The concept of a different story being told when traversing from one area to the next is amazing and put into practice very well. There isn’t anything about the ambient noise that feels annoying or out of place. While the music isn’t something that I would personally listen to in my free time, I can still recognize its beauty. It fits thematically into the game without a hitch and only ever complements the gameplay. I don’t necessarily have any love for the music, but it’s worth mentioning.;19560;;;;;c;43385;327412
4124;В итоге мы получаем все тот же Angry Birds, с внутриигровыми покупками, а также новыми механиками.;Если провести разбор этой игры, то можно понять, что это все тот же Angry Birds, только со своими механиками. Во первых тут есть два варианта прохождения уровня. Первый - это стандартный, как мы обычно и проходим, а второй - это тот, в котором мы используем дополнительных птичек. Покупать их можно за внутриигровую валюту. То есть мы можем использовать их в любой момент, что немного и упрощает прохождение.Также новинкой стал режим, где можно играть за светлую и темную стороны. В этом режиме можно использовать только этих дополнительных птичек. Как по мне это - лучшая часть в серии. Не знаю может тут замешена моя любовь к Звездным Войнам. Из минусов выделю лишь тот факт, что игра все еще является таймкиллером.;19272;Знакомство с игрой прошло году в 14-15, когда я начал играть во все части серии Angry Birds.

4126;В итоге мы получаем коротенькую визуальную новеллу, которая получила спустя 2 года после релиза ребут, в котором очень много изменений.;У главного героя свидание с девушкой. Ее зовут Ай и она опаздывает. После разговора о работе и о еде, они отправились в торговый центр, чтобы купить одежду и что-то для компьютера главного героя. После этого во время разговора одного из прохожих, они услышали о фейерверке. Главный герой узнает где он будет происходить и отправляется туда со своей девушкой. Они начинают наблюдать за фейерверком, а после чего игра крашится. Разработчик говорит о том, что он это предвидел, и собирается написать фикс этой проблемы. Он задался вопросом: На что я трачу свою жизнь? Вот и весь сюжет этой коротенькой новеллы. Только что я узнал, что есть и продолжение - Carpe Diem: Reboot, которое я когда либо пройду. А пока что мы получаем игру, в которой есть выбор, но он ни на что не влияет,как минус я это засчитывать не буду, потому как это и была задумка. У разработчика короткий, неработающий проект, без особого развития событий, спустя два года выходит ребут, в котором все стало гораздо лучше. Из плюсов посчитаю только то, что игра была сделана с душой.;33949;Знакомство с игрой произошло благодаря моему другу. Как то раз, просматривая его профиль Steam, я зашел в его обзоры.

4127;В итоге мы получаем одну из самых ярких игр в серии, в которой у нас есть возможность захватить Рейхстаг.;Серия Call Of Duty снова вернулась к теме Второй Мировой. Сама игра является прологом к Black Ops. В игре есть две кампании: за Америку и за Советский Союз. За последних миссии самые яркие и запоминающиеся. Вообще геймплей у этой игры иногда меняется. Тут у нас есть и миссия с танком, и миссия с самолетом. Игра прям пропитана старыми частями (Call Of Duty, Call Of Duty: United Offensive, Call Of Duty 2). Поговорим о плюсах и минусах игры. Первый плюс - это возможности игры. Мы можем поиграть за танк, а также полетать на самолете, ну а самое главное это то, что мы можем захватить Рейхстаг. Как по мне, это одна из самых запоминающихся частей Call Of Duty. Второй плюс - это небольшой упор на реализм. Тут у противника можно отстрелить все конечности. Сюжет тут не совсем имеет большое значение. Стоит только знать то, что главный герой в Советской кампании - Дмитрий Петренко, появится в следующей части подсерии- Black Ops, как и Резнов. Минусов нет.;625;Мое знакомство с игрой произошло неизвестно как. Возможно, она была в одном из сборников игр, которые я покупал.;-;6;1. Возможности игры. 2.

В самом начале ему дают задание выкрасть сокровище, но все идет не по плану, потому как Альтаир ослушался своих напарников. После провала, Альтаир возвращается в крепость ассасинов - Масиаф. Оказывается, что его остальные напарники смогли выкрасть сокровище, но привели за собой врага. Теперь нам предстоит отбиться от них. По завершении осады, Альтаира понизили в звании за провал задания, а сделал это его учитель Аль-Муалим. Он говорит нам о 9 наших врагах, убийство которых вернет нам звание мастера ассасина и поможет всему братству. Теперь нас ожидает довольно однообразный геймплей, он и является первым минусом игры. После их убийства, окажется что в списке было не 9 имен, а 10 и десятым является наш учитель, который был предателем с самого начала. У нас начинается с ним схватка, в которой он использует найденное нашими напарниками сокровище, которое обладает великой силой, но даже это ему не помогло, ведь Альтаир побеждает своего учителя и перед ним открывается карта других таких же как это, яблоко Эдема, сокровищ. Эта карта нужна организации в нашем времени, называемой Абстерго, которые являются тамплиерами. Они поймали Дезмонда, предком которого является Альтаир, и с помощью вычислительной машины - Анимуса, считывали его ДНК, чтобы узнать местоположение этих сокровищ. Тут, у Дезмонда появляется орлиное зрение (способность его предка), и он замечает, что все стены разрисованы кровью, на них оставленны послания от того, кто находился тут до него. Все это время, пока он находился в машине, ассасины пытались спасти Дезмонда, но он подмоги не вызывал. Оказывается, одна из сотрудниц - ассасин и она на нашей стороне. Так и закончилась история Альтаира и Дезмонда, но не навсегда, она продолжится в следующих частях, которые я в скором времени начну проходить. Из плюсов выделю отличный сюжет, хорошо проработанный паркур, а также боевую систему.;128;Знакомство с игрой у меня прошло в первый или второй год после ее релиза.

4129;;By far the greatest game I have ever played, based on a number of factors.  Its not the best graphics, Its not the a good story ( none basically), its not the best matching system, .... but its by far the most addictive, fun, adrenaline rushing game.   There are so many things that are great and it has amazing potential. This is truly a genre or rather a brand that could keep developing and become not only a game, but a hobby.   Now the bad stuff....   Why focus on the bad stuff? If the developer sort rhough these than this is a no-brainer and a must have for every gamer, no matter age, sex or preferred genre.   1. Lacking story.  Solution: Create a story. Im not talking about a tardy long story sequence that takes away game time and long loading screens. Just ad some personalization. WHY are we dropped into no mans land with 99 other players? At least bring us some cool, realistic background. Give us a reason to be the last man standing. Chicken dinner in all its glory.... ends up being nothing but a freeze static screen saying winner chicken dinner and thats it. Talk about anticlimax.  If not a story, add teams divided into nationality, Historical teams/environments or similar. Today it just feels unpersonal and gets worse by all the kids ( should be a +16 age limit) personalizing wardrobe so You end up in a fairly realistic game shooting, transvestites, clowns and 90% in underwear. Fun in an event, but not as standard...   2. Asian Cheaters.  Is it racist? Nope, its just a fact. Investing time in each game, multiplied over serveral years ends up alot of hours, only to 90% of the time end up killed by a aimbot/cheat that is easily found after 2 minutes of googling.  Solution: Better anti-cheat department. Impose better punishments. If an athelte today dopes up during a competition the repercussions are severe even jail time. Why? Its just sports... Well its due to money. A sports event includes so much economic investments. The crime itself of doping is  harming a select few, but the economic impact is large. Today when PBG make an excess of 920 Million USD in revenue, their should also be penalties when doping in this sport. All that is offered today is a report button, that is unheard of resulting in repercussions. Get a grip.   3. Matching system. Its rare to match up in teams or adversaries at your own level. Been on both sides, the noob dying within seconds - to fairly experienced that matches up with people asking what button is ´Fire´.   4. Maps.  LOVE the maps. Great. Wow. Amazing. Well done. ..... but fast forward 1 year and eating tacos for dinner gets boring. I know the work behind creating and launching a new map. But common.  Create new maps more often.   5. Cheaters again.  The reason I finally after 2 years, uninstalled the game and play Ring of Elysium instead. Hope to return when they announce some measures has been taken against cheating.   6. Gun control. Being an expert in CS, R6 and almost all FPS games from 1993 and forward, completely erased with PUBG. The gun controls, sensitivity is unique. Realistic? Not really. I havent killed anybody IRL but I have a background from the military and to say all other games is unrealistic and PUBG realistic is not really true. Of course the keyboard and mouse dilemma ( due to logitech monopoly and unwillingness to introduce VR) ads to it, but why is it so far from all the other games? Ive seen top ranked FPS gamers who simply cant kill in PUBG . And bottom line: its a GAME that should be fun. When it sometimes is impossible to shoot its a little bit to far.    PUBG could learn a lot from watching Ring of Elysium where gun control, cheaters, matching etc is better. ( However not copy whats bad with ROE - read my review of that here on IGDB);27789;;1. Lacking story.  Unpersonal.  1.1 Ridiculous character personalisation. Unrealistic.   2. Asian Cheaters. After 9/10 games being killed by aimbots isnt fun.   3. Matching system. Somewhat dysfunctional at times.   4. New maps to seldom. Repetitive even if high quality maps.  5. Cheaters again... is  the main problem.   6. Ad new match types offering some story ( Like Historical events, WW2, Nationalities, swat teams, battle for X, Map mimicking actual events etc );;1. Super fun, adrenaline, addictive. Can be a lone wolf camping sniper as well as a CQC team with advanced tactics.   2. Great graphics, large good maps, as well as smaller fast maps.   3. Wide array of guns, vehicles, buildings, environments etc makes this really broad and fun.   4. Quick loading. When in lobby its almost always 59 sec waiting. Pretty good for everybody over 12 yo.   5. Amazing sound effects. Having been irl battle, I can say that this is as real as it gets for Positional Audio-wise.;c;9362;235178
4130;;One of the greatest games I have ever played, hands down. For you who don’t have the time to read more. Here is a summary:  Its like PUBG, but … + better gun handling, less cheaters, good matching system, free.  -  Ridiculously unrealistic, clutter lobby with ads, ridiculous names/characters and graphical profile. (Mix Aliexpress with PUBG.) Only 1 map so far. Free games attracts underage kids.   Deeper look:  Other differences from PUBG that I could not decide as better/worse:  Instead of dropping from a plane you can spawn wherever you want, and then decide to loot alone or high speed grab and kill and land in the clutter.   You have some features such as grappling-futurized-hook, hang glider and BMX ( yeah I know haha).   Instead of last man standing, there is a helicopter that with 4 seats that you must board in the end. Fun cause there is then “4 winners” instead of last man standing. This is fun, but also a pain in the but if players decide to camp it out and wait for the others, which results in showing locations and becomes a very different game where everybody needs to refill health constantly. Very epilepsy – inducing and stressful.   The bad stuff which needs its own section:  There is nothing realistic at all with this game. If you add the character personalization feature, its even worse. This is somewhere in the future of a half robotic mankind that smells so much “chinglish” (Chinese trying to be westernized) that it can make you throw up😊.  Not only is the map called “Europa island” but all the villages ( its only one map in this game other than occasional season event maps) has names of famous robotics such as Asimov, Turing etc. It gets ridiculous when they added Era of battle cars and you basically could as well be playing a space galaxy-game.  The lobby is a MESS and almost like everything Chinese trying to cater to western clients (aliexpress etc) and its actually really hard to find stuff, a lot of advertising all over it. ( Well the game is free so sure, they have to make money somehow, I would prefer if there was an option to pay for the ads and clutter to go away on top of having it free brings a lot of small kids playing, yelling profanities etc. ).  The music which of course can be muted in settings ( if you find it) is a cringe-adder to all the other Cringe.   When you are at the end waiting to board the helicopter they have employed and recorded the first available American voice actor. Maybe through Fiverr or even grabbed the first Gweilo/gwailou (slang term for Westerners) on the street, cause it gives the cringe every time😊.  Its overall, a very very bad orchestrated visual/ branding strategy that caters to either western kids or Asian people, but smells “fake” for the average westerner.  Other than that it’s a GREAT gameplay, fun, exciting, and best of all a PUBG where you easily can fire and hit targets and rarely come across cheaters.   Mix Aliexpress with PUBG and you have this game. Fun, and all you need but with ridiculous selling points like “This mobile cover will change your life, you very  very happy always, China number one!” which we don’t really buy:) .   Its defendable for a free game to have limited maps. However a word of advice to keep developing the game would be to add more maps of course. After a while the “Cassini farm” (the name of a space research mission….zzzz  and a …. Farm, come on Alibaba, employ somebody who knows some marketing😊) and Turing city ( Alan Turing) and Artaud City ( Antonin Artaud jesus…… aaagh) becomes boring as any map. And another free tip for a free game. For 5 dollars there on Fiverr there are better voice actors for the helicopter.   The end screen when you win is better than PUBGs static page, but a “newspaper” showing the survivors is also a bit tacky😊. Who reads the newspaper in space😊?   The Lobby loading can sometimes be up to 8 minutes, so have your mobile ready to Tinder next to you😉.;95308;;1.

4131;В итоге мы получаем неплохой хоррор с интересным лором и сюжетом.;Мы играем за журналиста или репортера, короче за того, кто бегает с камерой и снимает все что попадется ему на глаза. Он приезжает в давно закрытую психиатрическую лечебницу, но открытую снова в 2009 году. Приехал он по причине того, что там происходило что то необычное. Прямо с входа его встречает куча трупов. Спустя некоторое время он уже хочет сбежать но у него это не получается и на него начинают охотится местные маньяки. В конце концов главный герой получает возможность сбежать, но вместо этого попадает в подвал, где производились эксперименты над людьми. Его начинает преследовать дух - Вальридер, у нас получается сбежать, но не совсем. Открываются двери, а там стоят солдаты. Они начинают стрелять. После того как наше тело упало мы слышим, как Вальридер разбирается с ними. Так и заканчивается Outlast. Я не очень хорошо передал здешний сюжет, но скажу так, он мне понравился, это и есть первый плюс. Второй плюс - это хоррор составляющая. Хоть я и не пугался, но особенное чувство все время меня преследовало, в частности во время чейзов.;1910;Знакомство с игрой прошло не помню как. Помню, что я о ней слышал из разговора одноклассников. Возможно, после их слов о том какая это страшная игра, я и решил ее пройти.;-;6;1. Сюжет 2. Хоррор составляющая.;Outlast;54105;327528
4132;В итоге мы получаем самостоятельное дополнение, которое вполне может сойти за еще одну игру в серии DEEP SPACE WAIFU.;По сравнению основной игрой, тут ничего не изменилось. Нам все также надо ездить на своем мотоцикле и стрелять в одежду красивых тян. Плюсы тут такие: 1. Красивые тян  2. Хорошая музыка. А минус в том, что иногда случается баг, при котором процентная полоска ломается и показывает не правильный процент прохождения уровня. Из за этого бага приходится перепроходить уровень.;77086;Узнал я об этой игре, благодаря ее основе -DEEP SPACE WAIFU, эта же игра является самостоятельным дополнением.;1. Баг.;6;1. Красивые тян. 2. Хорошая музыка.;DEEP SPACE WAIFU: FLAT JUSTICE;54105;327625
4133;В итоге мы получаем проект с неплохой задумкой, но с ужасной реализацией.;О сюжете я особо много говорить не буду, скажу то, что он ужасен. К примеру можно привести последнюю сцену в игре, где Коннор, жертвуя собой подрывает конвой корейцев. Необходимо было пометить цели и Коннор вместо того, чтобы просто кинуть в сторону конвоя шашку, он побежал вместе с ней к нему, и соответственно умер от взрывов. Также сценаристы иногда пытаются давить на жалость, а делают они это путем убийства персонажей, вот только загвоздка в том, что нам не приживаются эти персонажи. Вот серьезно, я даже не помню имя того мужика, которого убили в середине игры, вот настолько все плохо, а они еще пытаются давить на жалость. Однако, хоть сюжет и пойдет в минусы, отмечу, что задумка мне понравилась. Вторым минусом я посчитаю стрельбу. Я не знаю, что разработчики сделали с ПК версией игры, но чувствительности мыши скачет. От бедра скорость мыши большая,  в режиме прицеливания слишком низкая, а при управлении пулеметом она обретает скорость света. Также очередным минусом выделю баг, при котором весь экран был в полоску, случалось это только при полноэкранном режиме, поэтому мне пришлось пройти игру в окне. Вторым плюсом выделю небольшое разнообразие геймплея. То мы просто рашим, то у нас стелс миссия (о ней чуть позже еще поговорим), то мы управляем вертолетом. Это уже четвертый минус, игра слишком коридорная, слишком заскриптованая. Свернешь не туда? Тебя расстреляют снайперы, убьешь снайпера чуть раньше, чем надо было? Тебя заметят, даже если это было скрытно. Также очень часто я приходил на место раньше напарников, и мне приходилось стоять и ждать пока они дойдут. Ну и последним минусом будут редкие сохранения, тут даже объяснять не надо.;1885;Знакомство с игрой прошло в году 14, наверное.

4134;В итоге мы получаем довольно таки хорошее дополнение, которое закроет все сюжетные дыры.;История расскажет нам об одном работнике, который и сообщил главному герою основной игры о том, что в лечебнице происходят неладные вещи. Но этого работника выследили и объявили на него охоту, за нарушение тайны организации. Тут как раз и начинаются основные действия игры - нападения Вальридера, появление маньяков из оригинальной игры. Нам также предстоит прятаться от них и в конце концов мы сбежим на машине главного героя основной игры. После чего расскажем всему миру о действиях компании Меркофф. Вот такой сюжет в этом дополнении. Отсюда и его функционал - дополнить основную историю, закрыть сюжетные дыры. Сюжет - это первый плюс этой игры, ну а второй - это возможность посмотреть на одну историю с разных сторон.;9223;Узнал я об этом дополнении, к сожалению, уже после прохождения основной игры и ее удаления.

4135;В итоге мы получаем довольно таки годный инди проект. Хвала разработчикам, которые со временем добавили бесконечный режим по просьбе фанатов.;В этой игре очень важна реакция и внимательность. Нам предстоит отработать 7 недель. Играем мы вообще за Жнеца, которому предстоит выбирать, куда отправлять мертвецов: в Рай, Ад, или Чистилище. Чем дальше мы идем по сюжету, тем сложнее играть становится. Появляется все больше и больше условий, с учетом которых надо распределять мертвечину. В игре очень много отсылок на другие игры, на фильмы, и на многое другое. Тут можно встретить Гендальфа, Терминатора и многих других персонажей. Это и есть первый плюс этой игры - пасхалки. Скажу сразу, минусов у этой игры нет. Второй плюс - это черный юмор. Он просматривается даже в названии игры, наверное только русский человек поймет к чему я веду.;27976;Мое знакомство с игрой произошло благодаря Куплинову, в одной из нарезок я увидел эту игру и решил пройти ее.;-;6;1.

4136;В итоге мы получаем отличную визуальную новеллу, которая превзошла все мои ожидания. Так что советую сыграть в нее всем.;Я не буду пересказывать сюжет, но скажу то, что он тут великолепен и мне он понравился. Также тут очень красивая рисовка, для визуальной новеллы, где ничего, кроме статичных картинок нет, это важно. В этой игре были очень хорошо прорисованы все тян. Больше всех мне понравилась Юри, и соответственно я начинал отношения с ней. Вообще эта фишка с выбором тян, с которой главный герой будет проводить время, была круто сделана, это очередной плюс этой игры. Главной особенностью этой визуальной новеллы является то, что она ломает четвертую стену, это и отличает ее от ей подобных. Мы можем покапаться в файлах игры и удалить персонажа. Это отобразиться на сюжете игры.;55935;Знакомство с игрой прошло в те дни, когда я залил клавиатуру молоком, и она перестала работать.

4137;;Overall rating 8/10 the game is really nice and the story very interesting. The adventure of Dr. Freeman goes on. I liked the shooting the experience of that game and the weapons. The graphics are really good for its time. What I did not like (same as halflife 1) is the missing mission details / mini-map. If you have no mini map or at least a mission tracking list you just dont know what to do next and need search for the way forward. So if you dont like searching much, listen carefully to the NPCs so you know what to do next. I hoped valve would introduce some feature in hf2 that allow mission tracking but unfortunately not. However if you liked hf1 and the add ons you MUST play hf2 also!;233;;missing mission tracking list, missing mini map, Lack of information what to do next, need sometimes to search for the way forward;;graphics, shooting experience, environment, story;c;43279;327743

4140;В итоге, многими обожаемая первая часть в серии Deus Ex, на мой взгляд вышла ужасной. За первые 5 минут игры мне уже захотелось выйти из нее и удалить ко всем чертям. Тут виноваты не только те минусы, которые я перечислил выше, но есть еще много вещей, которые мне не понравились в этой игре.;Хоть многие и нахваливают эту игру, мне она очень не понравилась. За пару часов игры не было ничего такого, что могло бы зацепить и удержать в игре. По большей части я буду говорить о минусах игры, ведь как мне кажется, их тут много. Первый минус - это управление. Оно просто ужасно неудобное. Если хоть пару дней не играть в игру, после чего зайти в нее, то будешь путаться в кнопках, да и вообще забудешь за какие действия отвечают определенные кнопки. Второй минус - это левел дизайн. Все карты в игре довольно темные и однообразные. Все время ничего не видно и приходится пользоваться фонарем, а из за того что все выглядит однообразно - часто теряешься. Третий минус - это стрельба. Чтобы попасть по врагу - нужно секунд 10-15 в него целится, ну а он конечно же не будет стоять на месте, стоит нам чуть двинуться, то сразу же прицеливание сбрасывается и нам нужно ждать еще секунд 10-15. Единственным плюсом пожалуй выделю тот факт, что игра была сделана с широким спектром возможностей. У нас есть несколько вариантов прохождения каждой миссии.;41;Знакомство с этой игрой у меня произошло благодаря изучению серии игры Deus Ex, я наткнулся на нее и последующие части в серии.;1.

4142;;I initially found this game on itch.io after looking for something new to try. I really didnt have any idea as to what I could expect, but I have to say, I was blown away. This game is absolutely phenomenal. The storytelling, the unique characters, the wonderful art and majestic soundtrack all come together to create an experience that Ill probably cherish for the rest of my life. Its not a big-budget title, but the delivery is equal to that of any triple-A game.;15465;;;;Fantastic OST, Memorable Characters, Driven Storytelling;c;56568;328075
4143;;What the game may lack in general gameplay appeal it more than makes up for in uniqueness and the art style.   Picking flowers, smashing crates, fighting ghosts, and some fetch quest type stuff doesnt sound like a compelling mixture but it works for this one since the game is short and sweet.;12366;;The gameplay systems are pretty bare. It isnt always clear how to progress the story (The mini-map markers acted wonky a few times).;;Aesthetics and art style. The game knows when to end/doesnt overstay its welcome.;c;56548;328287

The more slow paced story driven RGP compared to the action packed hack&amp slash (which i also loved) had turned out really good.   Compared to alot of RPGs they created almost everything with intend and with good quality. Not all side quests where as good but most were pretty enjoyable, but the true gem is the world building and combat system.

4147;I think with a little time and hopefully some criticism being taken on board, MSGBO 2 can become a game that fans have wanted for a long time.;Starting up the game for the first time I had several notifications telling me I’d been given some free Mobile Suits due to surveys that were completed. Not complaining about the choices made but there are one or two I’d of not chosen given the opportunity.  I’d suggest doing the tutorials that are available after the initial tutorial because they left out some key battle functions like melee counters. Plus as an added bonus you receive some currency, tokens and the odd mobile suit used for some of the training scenarios.   Battles consist of ranked matches or unranked quick matches. Either in a space battle or on the ground, both space and ground battles play a little differently because of the obvious gravity limitations. Boosters overheat regardless of location when you use them for high-speed manoeuvres in space or using them to jump or dash on the ground.  Moving the Mobile Suit feels fine apart of camera movement is slow which I can kind of understand but comparing movement to the shows it’s like I’m turning a tank, even the Guntank in the shows turns quicker. Melee attacks are restricted to one attack unless your mech has a skill to allow multiple attacks which again, comparing to shows, is awful. I want to be able to counter an attack and go ham on my enemy, although countering an attack is something you need to time perfectly to do. Guns overheat and/or need reloading after a few shots and that’s fine with me.  The ability to crouch and go prone is quite a nice feature if you fancy shooting from a distance and doing either gives you slight stat boosts to health and attack depending on the position you’re in. Crouching allows you to exit your MS and move around the map as a pilot. Kind of like Titanfall but the pilot movement is a lot less graceful. The camera movement speed is the same as in the MS which is, as I mentioned earlier, a hindrance more than anything and you can’t edit the camera speed in the settings either, only the buttons. The jet pack for the pilot feels awkward when trying to move around but in a straight line, with the high speed boost, can get you to your destination a lot quicker than running. You can also do an emergency exit, I tend to use it right before my MS is about to be destroyed. There are checkpoints on the maps which you can claim while playing as your pilot, you can summon your MS (if it’s been destroyed or you deploy as a pilot) or use support strikes which can destroy multiple enemies in one hit if their health is low enough.  Battles have certain restrictions which correspond to the cost of deploying your Mobile Suits. Each MS has a different cost value and level, a level 1 mech will cost less than say the level 3 version of that suit. Obtaining more MS is simple, either exchange your currency or tokens in your usual gatcha style way. Weapons and upgrades can be obtained in the same way. Upgrades giving your MS a little boost to certain stats depending on what the upgrade is for.  Clans are a thing but I haven’t joined one yet. You need to be a certain player level to create one but I think you can join one at any point. Joining one gives you some bonuses I believe.;68285;I’ve enjoyed the Gundam series since I watched Gundam Wing back when it was on Cartoon Network’s Toonami. Since Crunchyroll have been airing a lot of the shows I got to watching some of them. Iron-blooded Orphans has become one of my favorite series so far. Wanting more of the series I’ve delved into some of the games from Crossfire to Gunpla Warfare. MSGBO 2 is a free-to-play, 3rd person shooter that plays ok but there are a few issues I personally feel make the game a little meh, but the game looks nice.;Camera speed is a little slow for my liking Pilot movement is wonky but manageable Needs a bit of work from the developers;48;Looks good Plays well;MSGBO2;11383;329618
4148;;Played through the regular version of the game for the first time. Its my own doing due to prior association but I kinda missed the soundtrack and altered camera angles from the dualshock version. When you get past the really messy tracks like the basement theme theres some pretty solid ones.  I forgot how ruthless some of the enemies can be in terms of stunlock and invincibility frames. The hunters and chimeras really dont play around. :(;424;;Some enemies are iffy behavior wise.;;Fantastic atmosphere and aesthetics. Rewarding map design and exploration. Replay value.;c;56548;330707
4149;В итоге, мы получаем очень хорошую игру. Знаете, а возможно, это лучшая игра на мобильных устройствах, в которую я когда либо играл.;По сюжету, с нами устанавливает связь студент, которому довелось оказаться на космическом корабле Варя, который потерпел крушение на неизвестной планете. Игра работает в режиме реального времени. То есть, если в игре должно пройти определенное время, то это время должно пройти и в реальности, проще говоря, если главный герой просит подождать пару минут, то это значит, что эти пару минут пройдут и в реальности. Главного героя, кстати говоря, зовут Тейлор, повторюсь, он потерпел крушение на неизвестной планете и смог выйти на связь с нами. Сейчас я вкратце расскажу сюжет игры. Тейлор рассказывает нам, что он видит поблизости. На фоне видно огромную пирамиду, от которой исходит зеленое свечение. Тейлор начинает свой путь к ней. На пути ему встречается разбитая каравелла. Он ее обыскивает и находит там необходимые для него припасы. А, забыл сказать о том, что обыскав свой корабль - Варю, он нашел там раненного капитана корабля - Айю. Он поместил ее в лечебную капсулу, чтобы она не погибла. Обыскав каравеллу, он пошел к пирамиде. Как заметил Тейлор, пирамида периодически отдалялась от него. Со временем он все же пришел к ней, и первое, что он заметил - это дверной проем. Зайдя туда, он увидел длинный, темный коридор, в конце которого был свет. Пройдя по коридору, он попал в командный центр, в котором была куча компьютеров. Изучив их, он узнал о том, что на этой планете потерпели крушение множество кораблей, более 30. Все дело в ЭМИ пушке. Тейлор послал сигнал S.O.S., на который откликнулся один космический корабль. Со временем, в этот командный центр пришли и остальные члены экипажа Вари, вот только проблема в том, что они были мертвы, а после заражены местным паразитом. У всех, кто был заражен, глаза светились зеленым светом. Тейлор попытался бежать, но они не дали ему этого сделать. Они пытались заразить Тейлора. Когда зараженные поняли, что подлетел спасательный корабль, они вышли наружу, чтобы заразить и их, но вот только Тейлор оказался быстрее, избежав заражения, он покинул эту планету. Вот такой сюжет у этой замечательной игры, я конечно же о многих деталях не упомянул в своем обзоре, чтобы его не растягивать. Поговорим о плюсах и минусах этой игры. Первый - это сюжет. Второй плюс - это последствия от принятых решений, каждый ответ несет последствия, от которых Тейлор может даже умереть. Третий плюс - это наличие нескольких концовок. Четвертый плюс - это стиль игры, сама игра проходит в виде переписки, что придает ей какую то уникальность, что ли. Минусов у нее нет.;19282;Знакомство с игрой прошло у меня еще в школьные годы.

4150;Overall this game is a bad game that is just as enjoyable as a good game, if you want a good laugh Id suggest playing this.;My favourite thing about this game is awful voice acting, its so lifeless and out of place that it makes me laugh every time. Brisco which is one of the characters in your team is so god damn funny that I had to pause the game and take a break, the other character in your team is a female reporter who gets replaced every time one of them dies, the new reporter and Brisco makes a single statement about the death of the character and then they never talk about it again. The gameplay is very simple, walk around with your camera and aim it at an enemy to have your reporter shoot it. There is also this push feature that if built up can lead to you sending your teammates flying. The most boring thing about this game is the enemy battles and story, I much more prefer the serious but in reality funny conversations between the your character and the team.;26294;Michigan: Report From Hell is one of those games that is so bad that its good so its hard to rule the positives and negatives.;Story Monsters Music Battles;8;Bad Voice Acting Pushing your teammates into oblivion Unintentionally Hilarious  Brisco;Michigin: Laughter in Hell;56608;330832
4151;;Wonderful world and character designed wasted away in a game that matches it with frustrating gameplay. The camera and controls go from unmanageable to decent at best. Theres glimpses of brilliance but theyre few and far between.  Probably the Naughty Dog game that has aged the worst out of the ones Ive played.;1528;;Abysmal camera. Frustrating vehicle controls. Poor checkpoint placement.;;The game has a lot of charm.;c;56548;330892
4153;After finishing this game for the first time I was stunned asking myself questions like, how can such a game exist?. Over the course of my life Ive played this game too many times to count, and I plan on playing it many more times. Everything about this game is just about perfect to me, and I doubt any other game will encapsulate the same sort of magic as this game did.;The story although may be convoluted and bad to some was interesting and didnt bore me at all, the over the top scenes in games always made me feel excited and cheesy dialogue is just something Ive always loved in games (Thanks DMC).  The combat was always fun for me, it felt quick and responsive and made me feel like I was in control at all times, the abilities were fun to mess around with, making me think which ability would be good to use on this boss?. The added customisation of keyblades makes the combat even more strategic, some keyblades would work better on some bosses while other wouldnt work so well. The critical mode difficulty made combat even more fun by increasing the challenge while still keeping it fair. The characters were enjoyable to follow and Final Fantasy characters were cool to see. I especially love Soras character in this game, he is not as bratty as he was in the first game but still a goofy kid. Roxas was also an interesting character to see as well although not appearing much, thats why 358/2 days exists which fleshes out his character a lot more. The environments are fun to explore especially since I was a kid who grew up with Disney movies.   While there are quite a few minigames in this game most of them arent forced upon you and the that are were quite enjoyable, gummi ship missions is something a lot of people complain about but honestly I had quite a fun time with them, they were a problem in the first game however, so it was nice that they improved it tenfold. The music may be my favourite thing about this game, music has always been important to me so I always find that I may be more lenient towards games, movies, anime with fantastic soundtracks. There is some sort of hidden magic that Yoko Shimomura included in her compositions that make me fall in love with it especially the end game music. The world themes, character themes, battle themes, boss themes and even cutscene music are all strokes of genius. The villains of this game were always so sinister yet cool and lovable all at the same time, first all shown as a sort of round table with black hoods with a dark and ominous piano piece playing in the background. Throughout the course of the game you encounter these hooded individuals and learn more about them, you learn their distinct style of fighting and how it reflects their personality. The final boss was so grand and made me excited every time he changed to a new form.;1221;Kingdom Hearts II is in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made and this isnt just my nostalgia speaking. When looking for video games I tend to go for RPGs, they are just the most enjoyable out of any other genre of games to me, there is however a problem, after playing Kingdom Hearts II for the first time my 5 year old self was entranced by it in which no other game had done before. This game got me into games, without it I wouldnt be who I am today. The only other game on par with this that I have played is Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne but that game is very different to this. I cant seem to find anything I dislike about this game, its like it was made specifically for me, meeting all the requirements I had and have for games. An interesting story with some over the top scenes and cheesy dialogue, fleshed out and satisfying combat with fun abilities to use and master, a challenging but still balanced difficulty (critical mode), likeable characters, great environments, not so annoying minigames, superb music and intriguing villains.;;8;Interesting Story Great Characters  Fleshed Out Combat  Fun Abilities To Master Great Environments Superb Soundtrack Fun Minigames Intriguing Villains;Kingdom Hearts II: A Truly Magical Experience;56608;328084

4158;After having a giggle with my main man T-Rex Terry and cruising around the city I’d say it’s a pretty fun city builder but the micro-transactions and laggy framerate put me off keeping this game in my library. I’ll probably give this another year or two of development before trying it again.;First off after starting up the game and watching an amusing, hand drawn cut-scene is the character creation. Now there are plenty of games with deep character customisation but this is something else. Bare in mind this is supposed to be a mayor of the city and although basic, the creation tool can make some funny looking characters. I give you T-Rex Terry.   Getting into the game you’re given free movement of your created mayor to do what you want, so I stole someone’s car and proceeded to run laps around the city. I wasn’t expecting to be able to steal cars in a city builder but there you go. The framerate while running around is awful, not sure if it’s my old PS4 or not but there are some quite noticeable frame jumps.  I’m pretty sure I was supposed to talk to the Mayor’s assistant first but after tearing ass through the city I stopped off at the mechanic’s and spoke to guy there. I proceeded to complete his given missions which included removing his mates ramp and destroying street lights in a stolen car.  One thing I noticed right off the bat was that some of the gameplay sounds come out of the dualshock 4s speaker, the characters running sound is the main one that bugs me. An example of a game which has a good use of the speaker is Warframe, incoming story messages come through the speaker which is mutable in the settings. I don’t understand why the devs chose to do this but can’t knock them for doing something most big developers don’t bother with.  The menu is pretty simple to navigate and find the things you’re looking for, as an example everything regarding building is under the buildings tab, city ledger for your stats and so on. The story missions require you to build your city and move buildings and do some nonsensical stuff like place some fireworks down and set them off. In the buildings menu it gives you a top down view of your city and apart from the usual build and upgrade options you can highlight a building with an “!” mark and start a story mission conversation, which you can do while free roaming by approaching the character and I find more entertaining by rocking up to someone in a muscle car, hitting a wooden bench, barrel rolling and landing perfectly in front of them.  After completing a few of the story mission I am required to go to the store located in the menu. This is where things, as you will probably guess, go from free to play to pay to play. Gaining additional resources and workers to build things will cost you real money, this is where the fun stops for me. Admittedly I have been caught by the micro-transaction trap but I’m not a fan of that business model but that’s for another discussion. Some avatar customisation items can be purchased with money made in-game but those super speed running shoes are going to cost you real money. You’re hard-earned money isn’t necessary to play the game but it will, as usual, in these micro-transaction type games take you longer to acquire resources and workers to continue to make your phallic shaped cities.  I joined the public hub and there were a few people chatting but it was your usual creep fest when hubs with chat functions are added to games. Now it’s time to give the game up.;24524;BCS is a free to play city builder but with a fun twist.;Poor Framrate The game doesnt know if its a city builder or not;48;Funny Customisation;Big City Stories;11383;331735

4167;;I had a really good time playing this, wasnt sure what to expect but it ended up being really fun. From the screenshots, I had thought it would be more of a shooter type game, and reading about the barricade mode enforced that, but it actually had a lot of RPG elements which I enjoyed, and given the release date the graphics are pretty decent for the time. I got it on a whim on sale when it was the game and all DLC for $10, but even paying the full price for the Storm Warning Edition would be worth it I think. At least, youll want to get the El Diablo island DLC - its a pretty lengthy quest thats more challenging than the main game, and just as fun.;7420;;Main quest is quite short Some bugs, particularly an annoying rag doll one where the player freezes for too long Combat can get repetitive and tedious;;Many varied weapons for different play styles Fun, trial and error crafting system Satisfying feeling of progress as you craft new weapons and acquire skills Different play styles including barricade and one shot escape Multiple characters with unique skills and weapons available to them;c;34321;332733
4168;;An improvement on the original in every way, while still keeping the best elements from the first game. The feeling of progress also exists within the world of the game, as the new setting and land to explore feels related to Dunwall but brings its own unique elements. The rat plague, for example, has become infected blood fly nests, a choice that feels more appropriate for the exotic new land of Karnaca. The tall boys have similarly become automatons, which aids the feeling of a world developing in its technology.   Playing as Emily also allows you access to all new powers, and there are many different ways to play, with different endings corresponding to your choices. You can play through the game hard fast and lethally if thats your thing, but Ive found it more rewarding to take a longer and stealthier approach, taking the time to explore each level.  Moreover, the levels are unique and well designed. The clockwork mansion is a particular favourite, as is the crack in the slab. Achievements and collectable also offer replay value. Overall, a fantastic game.;11118;;Some annoying bugs, particularly involving accidentally killing people while trying to get a non-lethal playthrough;;Somewhat stylized graphics that are pleasing without overtaxing your PC like hyper-realistic games might A world that feels lived in and highly detailed Multiple endings depending on your chosen playstyle A different experience based on which character you play as Multiple options to deal with each target, including non-lethal ones Rewards for players that take the time to explore the world An interesting story that feels like a natural sequel to the first game Intuitive magic and runes system that can enhance the game but isnt required;c;34321;332735
4169;;I really want to give this a higher rating, but there just isnt a way I can do that in the current state. To be honest, I had fun playing this, I really did. There is a good game somewhere in here, but its not here yet. For something that started as an IOS game, its pretty good, but it just does not stack up against other similar PC survival games, and without further development, it will remain unimpressive. However, it looks like that development isnt coming.;36287;;Unimpressive graphics Incredibly frustrating bug when transferring items Can become unbalanced (too easy) very quickly Spelling/grammar issues in plot journals make the whole thing feel unprofessional;;An admirable attempt at including many elements (crafting, hunting, combat, flying, etc.) Unique take on zombies;c;34321;332737

4173;;At the moment of writing the game has only 5 available missions which I have completed in one (very) long sitting. The game plays pretty much like a puzzle, and its a fun one. Missions complexity curves nicely too so its not hard to learn on the go. I dont even have any major complaints about it so its a good game to spend a few evenings on.;123748;;;;Nice difficulty curve No similar games;c;55985;333247
4174;;This one was a rollercoaster that I most likely will never finish. The game starts in a really awkward way where you just wanna mash Next button because story delivery is atrocious. Add to that several first quests that have you just walking back and forth between few NPCs and you just might want to quit right then and there. But if patience holds, quickly it becomes a fun, vaguely souls-like game. The areas are nicely crafted and if you get over how bad the delivery is, the setting seems interesting.  This game would score two stars higher if story pulled you in more, NPCs were more interactive and bosses werent frustrating with add spamming coupled with wallhacks.;105049;;Unforgivably bad story delivery No NPC depth Getting swarmed by adds in boss fights;;Setting Atmosphere Souls-like game;c;55985;333260
4175;;I first started the game as a hyper-smart detective who morally and physically resembled a wreck. Woke up, jumped on my fan to fringe my tie and died of a heart attack.  10/10 would jump again.  But seriously though. The game offers an immense depth in the character development that takes place continuously while playing. The start attributes are not negligible, from my point of view it is not possible to maximize your character in every skill. Nevertheless, you get so many points that you make good progress. The great thing about it is that you actually notice how your character is changing and the environment is doing the same. The way in which you react to unconscious decisions is great. For example, in one day I quickly ran everywhere and clicked my way through because I didnt have much time in RL. When I reloaded the game and ended the day ingame, someone made a snappish remark during a conversation to draw my attention to the fact that I am simply impatient. Such things subconsciously give you a great feeling while playing and also some memorable moments.  The game takes place quite slowly and is very text-heavy, only a few (important) passages are actually voiced. You have to deal with that.  Actually such games arent my favourite playground either, but this made me curious about the first trailer back then and I wasnt disappointed. I rate it a perfect 5 out of 7.;26472;I dont usually write reviews, but this is where I felt it was appropriate.;;6;;Text-heavy, serious RPG with dark humor and splendidly thought-out gameplay;37480;332156
4176;;Weird story, weird characters, weird vibe, this game is unique in the horror genre, it is not perfect, it has a lot of problems with the gameplay, but the overall result is something you cant experience elsewhere.;483;;Too long, the second half of the game can be repetitive sometimes. Some gameplay elements doesnt work, like the item management.;;The creepiest in the series, great visuals and creature designs.;c;57291;333411
4178;;Too much stealth, not enough action. Cannot shoot down a single target without the entire region ganging on your location. Weapons are impossibly hard to get. Hardly a spiritual successor of STALKER. Overall difficulty way too high. Not for casual gamers, like grown ups with jobs, which are sadly the main demographic (STALKER fans age group).;115054;;Horrible game engine.

4180;;Without a doubt, TBoGT is the best version of GTA IV. Galmorous, bright, different from the base game, and also from The Lost and Damned. The missions are super fun, and I wish GTA IV had more missions like these  plus adding frequent checkpoints got rid of the dread of replaying long parts of the missions already passed. The only negative thing about this game is that is it based on GTA IV, and thus has the same flaws.;3174;;Its GTA IV (physics, animation, slowness);;Glamor, fun Missions! Characters;c;47814;334573
4181;;It has been half a decade since I last played the game, but I remember it being quite fun to play on the ps3. There is this boost mechanic that gives you extra speed, which cools down overtime or if you drive through water. When you boost for too long, your vehicle explodes! Vehicles also explode when they crash. So, its fun to watch for teens and Michael Bay fans. Though tracks can be bit confusing, because of the environment that gets destroyed around you.;2555;;- Destroying environment can make it hard to find where you need to go;;- Strategic boost mechanic - Explosions!;c;35434;334913
4182;;A Plague Tale: Innocence surprised me a lot. I had been following the development and completion of this game for a while now, ever since i saw an ad for it on YouTube back in 2018. From the content available at the time i was a bit sceptical, but boy was i wrong...  I played through this game in one sitting, and this caused me to get incredibly attached to all of the characters (in particular, Hugo). All of the characters you run into along your journey are excellent, and really draw you into their little stories and timelines. It was nice to have some company along the way, and they helped me out a good few times too!  Talking of characters, as mentioned above all of the characters were really well implemented and the voice acting was excellent! A standing ovation to Hugos character as he really captured the innocence and child-like understanding of a Plague-filled world. My personal favourite bit was how he was pronouncing aqueduct as aki-duck (ugh my heart &lt 3)!  [SPOILERS BELOW]  )  Throughout the playthrough i was getting increasingly worried for Hugos health, and was dreading having to watch him die in front of me. This made it so much more gripping when we had to fight through the inquisition to get Hugo treated. At one point i honestly thought i was going to have to fight him, and i was battling a mental struggle on how i would cope if i did! Luckily we managed to avoid this and kill one of the most badass-looking enemies ive come across in a game so far! I was so relieved that we were able to get him back to his happy little self once again at the end.   The ending was a nice send-off too. At first i thought it was going to be cut short, but after the initial credits we got an ending that left me happy. Couldnt have asked for a better ending to be honest!;27316;;- Nothing! :);;- Emotional Storyline :) - Amazing voice acting! - Highly detailed worlds. - Dynamic hint system (no hand-holding). - Perfect length, didnt get boring.;c;57523;335089
4183;;If you are looking for a successful Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure game representative, dont hesitate and give Enigmatis: The Mists of Ravenwood a chance. In my personal opinion, the second part of the series is the best position in Artifex Mundis portfolio Ive ever had to deal with. The developers gathered all their best ideas and polished them to give the players an excellent project. They also did not forget about the addictive plot and skillfully created atmosphere, the factors that captured me in the Ghosts of Maple Creek. At the same time I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the collectors edition of The Mists of Ravenwood, because the bonus chapter deserves the attention of the audience, being a neat combination of prequel and epilogue.;17138;;- repetitive musical themes;;- addictive story - detailed, beautiful, hand-drawn locations - diverse levels of difficulty - mechanics similar to classic HOPA games;c;55458;321034
4184;;This review is written on Oct. 31st, 2019 and therefore the game is still in early access. I think its important to mention this.  Anyways.   After the unfortunately very terrible third part of the series, running with scissors now tries on the fourth part, which in my eyes already shows the potential behind it.   As the developers let us know, they want to go back to their roots with this title and i think you can already see that in this early build. As used to, we have a weekly cycle we play in, which is not fully included yet. No matter if I put a cat on my gun barrel, play football with heads or urinate through the neighbourhood and make people puke. It feels like it used to.  And it sounds like it used to. The same menu music, the speaker, you notice that they care about this title, thats also evident from their statements.  From a graphical perspective its not a highlight at this point, but it doesnt have to be. If they manage to continue developing the game well and build on the old values, Im sure that in a years time well have a solid successor to the second part.;124683;;Its an early acces build at this point.

4187;;This could easily be an alright 4X space-themed TBS game at its worst, but it isnt. Why? The reason is rather simple: performance. Even on a decent system, turn calculation takes so long that it starts to really irritate. Furthermore, the more objects appear in the game, the less responsive it feels, i.e. the more time it takes for every UI action to be processed. And while taking in account everything aforementioned, the game doesnt even make use of CPU all the way. Thus, as personally Im not a fan of wasting time on the results of poor software development, it is overall a bad game. A pity, really, as otherwise its really nice old-school thing reminiscent of first two Master of Orion installments, and if not for those performance problems, I would gladly play it for a long time to come.;110011;;Performance optimization.;;;c;33098;335732
4188;;Too big for its own good. Theres so many side quests, some good and some bad. Its difficult to differentiate and it becomes tedious working through them. This problem of depth also lies with one of the parts I really enjoyed of this game. Whilst the combat system is great in intertwining sword fighting with magic casting it gets annoying when you have to consider stuff like armour, sword, potions, oils and the upgrade and extra ability points that comes along with it all gets to be too much and takes away from some of the excitement of a fight when you have to set up the correct things.   In terms of narrative, it really didnt like it. The main objective is fine but it is there to set up a great adventure that I found not to be great. I really liked Velen and the Blood Baron but then Novigrad was just generic fantasy in concept and themes. Skellige had potential but fell flat and unexplored in its initial conflicts. Characters were completely uninteresting. Geralt is cool and fulfils his role well and the Bloody Baron had a great arc but thats it. Ciri was made to be likeable but there could have been so much more given the potential. Yen and the ginger bitch were actually both bitches- I just didnt remember the other ones name. That one progressive fool in Novigrad, whos Geralts best friend, is annoying as shit and he villains were flatter than an 8 year old.  I did enjoy the atmosphere and worldbuilding along with the fights but I dont value these things as much as I do the narrative- where it almost completely failed. So despite the great gameplay and experience, other than depth and scaling issues, I regrettably cannot fall for it like so many others.;1942;;Story and characters Too big and can sap time better spent;;Atmosphere (visuals/sound) Fights (in system (mostly) and concept of threats);c;57678;335750
4189;;Cubico is a simple, yet robust open world, arcade platformer in the same vein as Super Monkey Ball and Marble Madness where the overall goal is to roll around a set of features as a living ball and reach a given location. The game uses unique and fun mechanics to form a quite memorable experience.  Story  There isnt really a story, but this also isnt really the kind of game that benefits from having a story in the first place. So, pay no mind to this section.  Gameplay  This is where the real meat of Cubico comes in. As stated previously, the goal is to roll around the map and reach a goal, constantly dodging obstacles and solving bite-sized puzzles along the way. The rolling doesnt necessarily feel as weighty as I was initially expecting, due to many of the puzzles requiring constant jumping and precise in-air control. Even with the lack of weight, the movement still felt satisfying, especially after I was able to fully grasp the camera movement and the feel of the physics.  The game features a variety of puzzles that, although relatively short, are still fun to resolve. Many of these puzzles include a gameplay mechanic centered around a sort of box stretching for lack of a better term. The player uses the camera and mouse to lock onto a given axis of a shape on the map and stretch out any planes connected directly to that axis. This terrain manipulation leads to a very open-ended form of puzzle solving, which is especially appreciated when many other games of the genre take a my way or the highway approach to puzzle solving.  Art  The art in the game is simple, comprised entirely of basic polyhedrons and flat colors. There isnt much to say about the graphical fidelity, but the world design is fun to experience and quite a bit more vast than I initially expected.  Controls  Sticking with the theme of being simple and effective, the controls are comprised of a left click for terrain manipulation, WASD for movement, and Shift for sprinting. It allows for easy movement across the terrain and never really left me frustrated at any point.  Sound  This is probably the only part of the game that actually made me a bit annoyed at points. The music is very, very short. It also loops. Constantly. It’s not bad, it’s just constantly looping the same section over and over again. Also, when you die, it will restart the current song from the beginning. So basically, the music itself is pretty good, the implementation into the game is very poor.  Note  I should also mention that in other reviews, I was noticing people getting lost at points. Generally, the pathing is very direct, but there are points where the game will require the player to branch or follow a certain path to reach a given goal. I noticed that there will be a small, very detailed shape next to a few of the paths that will consists of many different either gray, or multi-colored layers. These shapes and the area that is colored, indicate the path that you’re following and the goal that you will complete by following the path.;120787;;;;;c;43385;336338

4191;;Good throwback to a game I had played on the Game Boy when I was a kid but with just enough newness to feel like a fresh experience. Graphically, the performance chugs at times with the drops in frame rate.;115284;;;;;c;29411;336365
4192;;The reason to write a more in-depth review rather than just giving this game 3/10 rating is disappointment. With this kind of narrative, given proper mechanics Demons Never Lie could be a really great game, but frankly, it isnt, and heres why.  First of all, graphics. While they generally look nice, overall theres no single consistent style to it. Theres a total of six distinctive main graphical styles throughout the whole game: low-poly environment (including interactive objects), voxel-ish characters, charcoal inventory, sketchy 2D character portraits, painted strips for character speech and modernishly neutral semi-transparent rectangular boxes for character choices. Needless to say, theres no in-game reason for such an abundance of style. It rather looks like the game had to be slapped together as soon as possible with no regards as to its visual consistency. It also doesnt help how bad character portraits actually look, especially respective demon and angel ones, the first one simply looking unfinished, and the second strongly reminiscent of the feels guy meme. Overall, theres overabundance of graphical styles in the game, which have very poor cohesion with each other, which could really be reduced for the benefit of the game – e.g., at least the character portraits couldve been easily done in the same charcoal-playing-card style as the inventory.  Then, narrative and mechanics interaction. With this kind of setting, one could hope for much more non-linearity than there is. Really, theres so much unrealised potential there that it makes me feel really frustrated. Given how short each episode is, and how few are characters choices, the gameplay could really encompass all of the characters in it, also making each playthrough much more unique. Instead Ive played through the game twice, and its linear as hell, with player choices meaningfullness next to none.  Lastly, UI. Theres almost none of it, really, so it feels especially frustrating how clunky and unresponsive it is done. Theres really no reason for a player to decide whether she or he wishes to continue playing each time the game is saved, and even less than none for those pesky 1s pauses between choosing whether to save the game and whether to quit it. Also, decision timers are much too fast for my taste, though this matters little since how little those decisions actually mean.  Overall, the game literally feels half-baked: it looks and smells nice, but inside theres a lot of not very edible hot dough, and it really couldve been much better with little effort.;117303;;Graphic style inconsistency, utter linearity, clunky UI.;;Low-poly style execution, overall story and setting.;c;33098;336370

4195;;Turn It On! is a simple puzzle game that excels in most of its presentation, but falls flat in virtually every other category. At $0.99 or $0.00, it may be worth the 45 minutes required to complete the game, but at $1.99 there are better options available.  Foreword: I was kindly provided the code for this game directly from the developers over Twitter in exchange for a review and feedback.  Story:  There isnt really any story in Turn It On!, nor any sort of driving force to lead the player between the levels. There is a small animation of a spaceship preparing to lift off that doesnt seem to be related to anything in the game, but other than that theres nothing.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is that of a standard blackbox puzzle game where you have to figure out how to activate the specific device you are interacting with. Unfortunately, in Turn It On! all of these puzzles are either way too easy or lead the player to guess for the answer. If the puzzles were more engaging, the game may be worth more the time and money, but as it stands there really is no feeling of accomplishment or satisfaction from finishing any of the puzzles. Overall, the gameplay feels lackluster and boring.  Art:  Turn It Ons! art is fairly nice. Nothing particularly stands out, but the puzzles are well modeled and the worlds are inoffensive. The major issue with the games art style is that theres no story to base the art style off of, leading to a disconnected and inconsistent style. Luckily, the menus are simple and easy to understand.  Controls:  The controls are simple and easy to understand. They seem based off of other examples of manipulating a static object in a 3D environment on a mobile device, and are well replicated. The only issue with the games controls is when there are things to manipulate on the side of the object, where the controls become unreliable.  Sound:  The music in Turn It On! is simple and forgettable. None of it is particularly bad, it just falls flat due to the lack of an overall theme and story to build off of and work with. Luckily, the sound effects are well done and respond nicely to player input.;95776;;;;;c;43385;336446

4198;;So, Watch Dogs 2... Frankly, I am disappointed. I loved the first installment: it was witty yet simple, fun yet serious, and structured yet eye-catching. The story was good and personal. With Watch Dogs 2, we get a story that is trying to be cool-instagram-flashy, and ends up being very uninspiring, uninteresting, full of cliche, and very on the surface. The developers improved the driving, but got rid of a lot of the collectibles, side missions, races, and replaced them with more online events that spawn over and over, which kills any sort of excitement. Despite the negatives, the game holds its head high with some improvements, but it doesnt justify its price tag.;19441;;Story Characters Online stuff No structure;;Improved game mechanics Driving;c;47814;337785
4199;;Celeste feels great while also hurting so bad. I knew this. Every review I read before I started explained how people wanted to break their controllers in half, and I agree. No game on my HDTV has ever made me question so harshly how many milliseconds of latency there, how I could be losing a precious more millisecond or two my controller by wire, how I could really use new rubber on my joysticks or even that fancy pro controller thats probably over $100. ...for a 2D platformer? Yes. Why? Why bother? Because its beautiful.;26226;;The platforms themselves were put there to make you rage quit. And, bad news, thats the only thing you do the whole game.;;Expert audio.

4232;;Flatout 4 is such a beautiful game which just doesnt deliver. Muscle cars, great looking tracks and crazy car crashes catch your eye, but once you start the career/flatout mode, you realize that something is missing, and you think that maybe that *something* is going to come later. But it just doesnt. It looks like a worse version of the very successful Ultimate Carnage, and this is a huge disappointment. It is a good game for one night. However, the multiplayer is always fun, so if youve got friends to game with, this is not the worst choice.;27043;;Decline of the series is visible Looks unfinished;;Great detailed tracks Multiplayer Graphics;c;47814;337944
4233;;One fine day you find yourself waking up at a mental hospital. You just lost everything you had  your family got killed, and your lovely kitty ran away. Therefore, you find yourself alone. Hopeless. Isolated. They wont let you out, but you need to try finding an exit. The only beam of light is the certainty of finding Mr. Midnight - your cat. Diagnosed with psychosis, you keep witnessing weird appearances  your surroundings covered with blood and something obscure chasing you. It seems to be wanting to devour you, and, mostly - your soul along with hope. You wont let that occur as you have your caring black furry friend talking to you and giving you strength. You have to find it, no matter what happens.  A twisted point and click that will let you experience (and therefore, learn!) some aspects of mental disorders in first person. Desperate, yet so sweet.

4234;;There is no place for one who lingers about.  PRICE is a tiny game which foremost subject is intensity of bonds and efficiency of sacrifices.

Awesome background music and the art style is simply beautiful. The main story made me recall something Ive read in the past, but I surely didnt find it so repetitive to the point of getting bored. Quite the opposite in fact.  Before starting the game I already knew it would break me a bit. Totally recommend it.;32771;;;;;c;58030;337987

4238;;Sweetest Monster is a Kinetic Novel (= no choices involved) presenting a ~3 hour long read accompanied by eerie music and sound effects which will lead you to a mysterious yet nostalgic universe. The art is really well done, both character sprites and scenery are awesome. The story presents some plot twists, yet, from another perspective its quite realistic and relatable. Id say the main topic of this game is life. How some choices might alterate the situation you are living (and sharing with your surroundings) significantly, and, eventually bring you a dreadful sense of guilt. Characters are well presented, relatable personalities, interesting traits, nice coloring. +Also, some fanservice is presented but its not the main point of the story.  8.5/10;27301;;;;;c;58030;337991

Going deeper into the story, you will find some more and more details about past of your heroes, especially their memory and origins.

Each level is its own puzzle, but only according to the loosest definition of the term  the puzzles are very easy. My main issue with the game is that there is no challenge. The game prioritizes art over entertainment. The story also just gets in the way of what little gameplay there is.;55080;;- After an hour, you just want it to end - Overpriced;;- Unique concept;c;35434;340163
4242;;SMB3 is probably the NES/Famicom game that I’ve spent the most time playing. This is really where the Mario series hits its stride, with a lot more storage space to work with than in the past. But it’s still certainly built from the groundwork set by SMB1  Mario runs, jumps, and collects powerups. He still has a lot of acceleration and momentum too, but he’s much more maneuverable in the air now, so it’s easier to save yourself after a bad jump. Acceleration is also emphasized with the P Bar, a display that measures Mario’s current speed.  The most important addition for Mario himself, though, is the Super Leaf powerup that becomes more prominent than the Fire Flower in this game. It’s brilliant for a couple reasons: It rewards you for reaching maximum speed by giving you the ability to fly if you do, and it lets you fall more slowly to land tight jumps.  While the Fire Flower is a projectile focused on safely dealing with enemies, the Super Leaf is mostly about helping with platforming, Mario’s other big challenge. It’s hard to imagine a more perfect addition, and while there are a plethora of other new powerups in the game, they’re less common and less game-changing. Things like the Frog Suit or Hammer Bros. Suit are more of a fun bonus.  There are 90 levels in the game, and all of them stand out by focusing on a specific idea, whether that’s a new enemy type, platforming challenge, puzzle, or persistent obstacle like the Angry Sun or Boss Bass, a giant fish that kills you instantly if it eats you. Some ideas are better than others, but individual stages remain on the short side, so they never outstay their welcome. The airship stages at the end of each world do all feel very similar, but those aside, most levels manage to leave an impression. This is in stark contrast to SMB1 especially, where the stages blend together so much that it’s easy to miss how some are nearly identical copies of each other.  This game has some particularly hard levels toward the end, among the hardest in the series outside Japan’s SMB2, but it also lets you collect and stockpile powerups that can help skip or significantly reduce the challenge of these levels. Namely, if you save the P Wing items you collect throughout the game, you can use their infinite flight to skip through the toughest stages. It’s one of the better implementations of variable difficulty I’ve seen in a platformer. There are no difficulty settings, but the game provides some limited tools to reduce the challenge wherever you feel it’s necessary.  If there’s any serious flaw in SMB3, it’s the fact that you can’t save the game. It’s far from impossible to play through in one sitting, and there are hidden warp items which the game itself alludes to that can help you get back where you were, but it still takes a few hours when played casually. You could save in plenty of games by 1988, so it’s a bit of a mystery as to why you can’t in this. Thankfully there are now plenty of other ways to play SMB3 which do have a save feature, so this is only a problem if you’re playing on a Famicom/NES.  To this day, this is still my favorite 2D Mario game. In many ways, it feels like where evolution stopped for this style of Mario. There’s an unmistakable jump in scope and creativity between this game and previous Marios, while Super Mario World only feels like a lateral step. SMB3 set a standard that Nintendo has only been trying to match for the last thirty years, and for that alone it deserves a lot of credit.;1068;;;;;c;58268;340223
