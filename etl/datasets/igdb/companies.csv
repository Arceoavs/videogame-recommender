14;826;Bullfrog Productions was a British developer. It was founded in 1987 by Les Edgar and Peter Molyneux. They were best known for their strategy god games such as Populous.  In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts Canadian studio.  Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded game was Sim Theme Park (also known as Theme Park World and Theme Park 2), released in 1999.  A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000.  Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.;{9226, 780, 12434, 5525, 283, 35, 36, 75301, 5423, 49, 50, 51, 8893, 8894, 4415, 12484, 12104, 1624, 19422, 10207, 355, 12278, 14455, 248};Bullfrog Productions;;{12434};1987-03-31 00:00:00

17;124;Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the worlds top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry. Headquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.  Beginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.  Digital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.  Digital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe;{544, 1888, 9179, 25160, 6220, 6959, 272, 273, 68335, 6228, 31189, 111285, 2903, 7549, 5979, 1885, 926, 927};Digital Extremes;;{68335, 55218, 111285, 31189, 2903};1993-12-31 00:00:00

106;840;Loki Entertainment Software, Inc. was a video game developer based in Tustin, California, United States, that ported several video games from Microsoft Windows to Linux. It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.  Although successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.  Excerpt from their archived website: Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.  Unlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the power of the people. Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their companys specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.  Loki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.  For Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.;{3111, 364, 3085, 922, 667, 767};Loki Software;;{355, 364, 3111, 863};1998-11-09 00:00:00

268;124;History from MobyGames: Founded in 1995, Global Star Software Limited was originally located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The company became active in the software publishing field and branched out from its roots in value PC entertainment to offer a variety of business and utility software, as well as software for a variety of other platforms.  The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Canada, Inc., which in turn was a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.  In 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products. Global Star also continued its efforts in the PDA software market, spearheading new initiatives such as multi-platform releases for both Palm and Pocket PC devices.  By the end of 2002, Global Star was reorganized and became a division of Take-Twos Jack of All Games Canadian operations along with Triad Distributors. Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Stars products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games sales force to strengthen the companys position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.  The Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.;{27454, 2702};Global Star Software;139;{8834, 4103, 5767, 6151, 6156, 24077, 2702, 5777, 5786, 5788, 294, 7974, 5932, 22449, 3892, 6015, 6587, 27454, 4800, 7881, 1995, 5838, 47312, 69843, 9429, 4056, 5977, 3806, 5732, 5864, 107, 3437, 9203, 6389, 2812, 766, 4095};1992-12-31 00:00:00

Io-Interactive is here to deliver exciting world class entertainment, and we want our games to play and feel like the people who created them. It is our way of making sure that we will always deliver something unique and interesting. This requires not only lots of work but also lots of guts, talented people and a great working environment and we do our utmost to have all of this.    We’re doing as much as we can to make IOI feel like a second home. We meet in the morning and share breakfast, eat lunch together and party together. On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building.

291;528;Nixxes Software BV is a group of highly experienced game technology programmers.    The company was founded in August 1999 and has since specialized in helping other game developers and publishers making the best out of their game content.    -    We do this either by:    ○ Bringing high quality conversions to other platforms, both console and PC.    ○ Assisting in getting a game out faster and better.    ○ And by working with studios to build technology that helps people make better games.    Over the past 15 years we have worked with machines varying from the Sony PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast to current-gen and next-platforms platforms. In addition we have a long history working with PC conversion projects and we are currently developing new technology for PS4 and Xbox One.    We strive to completely understand every platform we work on, and use this knowledge to get the best out of games. This way the game teams can focus on getting the best possible content, while we push the machines to make it all run well. Weve worked on several products since we started, which you can find more information about in our projects section.

292;826;Travellers Tales was founded in 1989 by Jon Burton. Initially a small company focused on its own content, it grew in profile through developing games with larger companies such as Sega and Disney Interactive Studios.    In 2004, development on Lego Star Wars: The Video Game started with publisher Giant Interactive Entertainment, and, the following year Travellers Tales purchased and merged with Giant Interactive Entertainment, forming TT Games. From that point, Travellers Tales served as the companys development branch, while Giant Interactive Entertainment became TT Games Publishing, the publishing branch. In 2007, the company acquired another developer and an animation studio, which became TT Fusion and TT Animation.    On 8 November 2007, Warner Bros.

295;840;Brothers Richard Garriott and Robert Garriott, their father Owen, and Chuck Bueche founded Origin Systems in 1983 because of the trouble they had collecting money owed to Richard Garriott for his games released by other companies. The companys first game was Ultima III: Exodus  because of Ultimas established reputation, Origin survived the video game crash that occurred that year. It published many non-Ultima games, and Richard Garriott claimed that he received the same royalty rate as other developers.    By 1988 Origin had 15 developers in Austin, Texas, and 35 other employees in New Hampshire. In September 1992, Electronic Arts acquired the company for $35 million in stock, despite a dispute between the two companies over EAs 1987 game Deathlord. Origin, with about $13 million in annual revenue, stated that it had considered an Initial Public Offering before agreeing to the deal. By 1996, Origin had expanded to more than 300 employees, most of whom were divided among small, largely autonomous development teams. In 1997, Origin released one of the earliest graphical MMORPGs, Ultima Online. After this title, Electronic Arts decided that Origin would become an online-only company after the completion of Ultima IX in 1999. However, within a years time, in part due to Ultima IXs poor reception, EA canceled all of Origins new development projects, including Ultima Online 2, Privateer Online, and Harry Potter Online. Richard Garriott left Origin shortly after and founded Destination Games in 2000.    In later years, Origin mainly existed to support and expand Ultima Online and to develop further online games based on the Ultima franchise such as Ultima X: Odyssey, originally to be released in 2004 but later canceled. In February 2004, the studio was disbanded by Electronic Arts. The Longbow series of simulation games was developed at Origin and published under the Janes Combat Simulations brand of Electronic Arts. A follow-on project, Janes A-10, was under development when the project was canceled in late 1998 and the team moved to other projects.;{773, 656, 14483, 6165, 794, 924, 2588, 24990, 47224, 7840, 12707, 2213, 934, 935, 102055, 102056, 7083, 940, 2867, 2868, 3126, 4281, 2878, 12229, 12230, 11335, 12486, 592, 2520, 74328, 70136, 2412, 23279, 7414, 8824, 2428};Origin Systems;1;{14483, 6165, 23, 924, 24990, 12707, 2213, 102055, 940, 2867, 2878, 12229, 12230, 11335, 12486, 586, 2520, 74328, 2530, 2412, 12908, 23279, 8691, 7414, 47224, 2428};1983-01-01 00:00:00

317;840;Dynamix, Inc. was an American developer of video games from 1984 to 2001, best known for the flight simulator Red Baron, the puzzle game The Incredible Machine, the Front Page Sports series, the acclaimed Betrayal at Krondor, and their online multiplayer game Tribes.    The company was founded in Eugene, Oregon in 1984 by Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye. Their first title Stellar 7 was released before company founding and was later re-released with the Dynamix name on it. They made a number of games for the Commodore 64, among them Project Firestart which was one of the most atmospheric titles for the C64.    In the following years, Dynamix created a line of action games for Electronic Arts, including one of the first games for the Commodore Amiga, Arcticfox. Later titles were developed for Activision. After self-publishing their games for a short while, in 1990 Dynamix was bought by Sierra On-Line.    Once part of Sierra, Dynamix created some of their most famous games, including a line of adventures and flight simulations that included Red Baron and The Adventures of Willy Beamish. They also created the puzzle game The Incredible Machine, along with the spinoff Sid & Als Incredible Toons. Another successful product line was the Front Page Sports series, designed by Pat Cook and Allen McPheeters which included Football, Baseball, and Golf. Versions of Red Baron and Front Page Sports Football were included as part of the ImagiNation Network.    In 1994, the first game in a new series called Metaltech was released, a giant robot combat game with similarities to the BattleTech universe and games. This series resulted in two Earthsiege games and eventually Starsiege. As a side development of the Starsiege game, the successful Tribes series was created. Dynamix also created Outpost 2: Divided Destiny, the second game in Sierras strategy/survival franchise, Outpost.    The Dynamix studio was closed by its parent company Sierra Entertainment on August 14, 2001, as part of Sierras restructuring under Vivendi Universal. Several veterans of the studio (including Tunnell), however, stayed in Eugene and founded a new studio / electronic publisher, GarageGames.    After several years at GarageGames, Dynamix co-founder Jeff Tunnell and long-time Dynamix employee Rick Overman have founded PushButton Labs in Eugene, with the intent to further develop web-based video games.    After over 10 years of retirement, Dynamix co-founder and game designer Damon Slye returned to the games industry to start Mad Otter Games in Eugene, Oregon in 2007 alongside several other key ex-Dynamix employees. Mad Otter Games released the online World War II dogfighting game Ace of Aces in 2008 on the web portal InstantAction, though after InstantAction was shut down the company revealed they would be re-releasing the game on their own website (as of August 2012 the game has not been re-released).

543;826;Rage Software or Rage Games or FX Digital Network was a British video game developer. Formed in Liverpool in 1992, its games were marked by an emphasis on graphical effects with arcade gameplay.  Rages first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry. The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles.  Rage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999.  In 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy. At that time, it was one of the oldest game developers in the UK and at its peak had offices in Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington.  Some of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham, Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle.;{25120, 673, 2401, 5858, 6017, 6369, 6214, 10434, 18625, 10281, 92814, 752, 12720, 25109, 45816, 54012, 4093, 2399};Rage Software;;{6017, 5858, 6369, 752, 6421, 4093};1992-12-31 00:00:00

728;826;Just Add Water (Development), Ltd. was founded in 2006 by British career developer Stewart Gilray. The studio worked as a sub-contractor on a number of titles before moving onto its first unique project, Sony-published retro shooter Gravity Crash, in 2008. PS3 and PSP versions released in 2009/2010.  JAW went on to sign a far-reaching contract with Lorne Lanning’s Oddworld Inhabitants to develop properties in the Oddworld franchise, a move Gilray describes as a “turning point”. Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath HD, a conversion of the 2005 original, released in 2010 for PC then a year later for PS3, then followed in 2012 for PlayStation VITA.  Towards the end of development on Stranger’s Wrath HD, the team moved over to start development on what would become Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, VITA, PC, Mac and Linux.  Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty launched in July 2014 on PS4 to critical acclaim, with other platforms arriving in the months following. The title did well to beat its own 12 month sales prediction within 2 months of release.  The team also revisited their title Gravity Crash, by creating a PlayStation VITA version titled Gravity Crash Ultra, released in August 2014. 2014 and 2015 has seen JAW work with new Partners and Clients.

766;840;Retro Studios, Inc. is an American first-party video game developer and division of Nintendo based in Austin, Texas. The studio is best known for its work on the Metroid Prime series and the Donkey Kong Country series, and has contributed to several other Nintendo game projects, such as Metroid Prime Hunters and Mario Kart 7.  Retro was founded in 1998 as an alliance between Nintendo and former Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg, hoping to create titles for the then-upcoming GameCube aiming at an older demographic. The company begun working on four different titles, all of which were finally cancelled once Retro focused their resources on Metroid Prime, the first Metroid title developed outside of Japan. The success of Metroid Prime led Retro to work on two sequels, and later to become involved with reviving the Donkey Kong series with Donkey Kong Country Returns.;{2923, 1100, 37136, 1105, 1106, 1108, 1111, 1112};Retro Studios;773;;1998-12-31 00:00:00

915;840;Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers who have served at Irrational, Blizzard North, Harmonix, Iron Lore and 38 Studios. The teams first project is the ARPG Grim Dawn. Weve put years of passion into making Grim Dawn a worthy, stand-out title amongst other great games in the genre. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year with the full release of Grim Dawn in February 2016, the start of its expansion and possibly the announcement of another new project.      Crate Entertainment was founded in 2008 by former Iron Lore lead designer Arthur Bruno with the goal of continuing to create deep gameplay, with creative integrity, in original fictional settings. At a time when some were still proclaiming the demise of PC gaming, the founding of Crate was, to some degree, a way to keep working on the type of more traditional, complex PC games that we love.      In late 2009, Crate acquired the rights to the Iron Lore codebase and began working on a new Action-RPG that would become Grim Dawn. For the first few years, Grim Dawn plodded along with only two full-time developers, supported by volunteers.

928;840;Supergiant Games is an American video game development company based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp  Conquer series of video games.  Their first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several Game of the Year lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its PAX 10 highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 Summer of Arcade promotion.  In March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.;{113112, 18822, 3022, 1983};Supergiant Games;;{18822, 3022};2009-12-31 00:00:00

1022;840;Located in Redmond, Washington, Turn 10 Studios is the creator of the Forza Motorsport franchise.    Turn 10 is a subdivision of Microsoft Studios, established in 2001 as a first-party racing game developer. Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support.    Building off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net.    In late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success.    Released in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios.    With Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience.    In 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world.    Forza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun. In March 2015, Turn 10 released Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious, a standalone expansion for Forza Horizon 2, inspired by the Fast & Furious film series and featuring many of the cars from Universal’s blockbuster action film, Furious 7.;{3072, 3073, 36872, 8558, 78511, 2131, 3068, 3069};Turn 10 Studios;17966;;2001-12-31 00:00:00

1056;276;Piranha Bytes are developers of computer games located in the Ruhrgebiet, Germany’s industrial heartland. They have developed the much acclaimed GOTHIC® (publisher: Shoebox and JoWooD) and Risen® (publisher: Deep Silver) computer roleplaying series.  Pluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germany’s Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytes’ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.  It was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.  Pluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares are held by staff and management. Current (2013) permanent staff is around 20 people - all but of one doing active development (designers, programmers, scripters, artists...).;{2444, 11567, 2481, 2261, 2262, 2263, 3802, 6142};Piranha Bytes;10075;;1997-01-01 00:00:00

In the last years we gathered ample experience developing award-winning games, employing highly optimized workflows and making a name for ourselves in the games industry.

We love great games, we value quality, passion and art, and our products are meant to reach the masses.  There are three pillars that build the foundation of our studio: Creativity - Taking a fresh approach to existing genres with instantaneously recognizable art styles. Production - Always delivering on time and on budget. Even for first-time projects and challenges. Technology - Consecutively enhancing our efficiency and product quality via modularized in-house framework.  If we do it, we do it right – including work-for-hire projects, which will receive as much love as our own. If we agree to work on them. We are consistently growing by accessing multiple game design universities and freelance professionals, identifying the best talent only.

1234;826;Formed in 1982 by Mark Cale, System 3 is recognised as one of the founding pioneers of the gaming industry and as a name synonymous with producing original genre defining gaming concepts year on year. System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years  2012 marked System 3′s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the company’s long and fruitful history!  From early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.  In the mid 1980′s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.  As the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3′s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.  In 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.  A critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.  In 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs  Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.  System 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including  Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.;{11937, 13601, 70279, 8397, 39021, 8400, 8401, 8403, 2614, 8407, 45334, 12187, 26780, 39039};System 3 Software;;{11937, 13601, 4067, 7462, 12103, 76648, 85546, 8397, 5198, 8400, 8401, 91376, 9140, 45334, 4855, 8407, 12187, 26780};1982-12-31 00:00:00

1287;392;Irem is a Japanese video game console developer and publisher, and formerly a developer and manufacturer of arcade games as well. The company has its headquarters in Hakusan, Ishikawa Prefecture.  The company is probably best known for Moon Patrol, the famous scrolling shooter R-Type and the earliest beat em up, Kung-Fu Master. They have been a popular developer in Japan with games like Photoboy for the PC Engine and In the Hunt for the arcades, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. Irem is also known for making their arcade games extremely difficult, and most of them feature a dip switch that allows you to play a no death mode as a result, in order to allow gamers to be able to complete their tough games.  As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games.;{6791, 4626, 6550, 12314, 75674, 19619, 121515, 2733, 11695, 11696, 11697, 11698, 78145, 6854, 6855, 39503, 10448, 75857, 10450, 92368, 2901, 10457, 14693, 28397, 121716, 4603};Irem;;{4621, 4626, 6550, 49048, 19619, 40238, 11695, 11696, 11697, 11698, 86202, 78145, 6854, 6855, 42574, 39503, 10448, 75857, 10450, 2901, 10457, 14693, 28397, 12271, 85620, 4603, 4605};1974-12-31 00:00:00

1309;840;Avalanche Software, LLC is an American video game developer, founded in October 1995 by four lead programmers from Sculptured Software. The company has developed for every console platform since the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES days and has grown to a staff of over 100 since its inception. The company is headed up by CEO John Blackburn.    The studio had been acquired by Disney in 2005, and spent the next ten years developing Disney-related titles, including the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity in 2013. By 2016, the toys-to-life market had started to falter, and Disney closed down the studio in May 2016.

All three of them previously worked together at Infogrames as a part of the internal Eden development group. By forming the company, Eden became independent. The studio initially signed contracts with Infogrames for two V-Rally games, but asserted its independence by signing a publishing agreement with Electronic Arts in 1999.  In May 2002 the company was sold to the Infogrames Group (that later became Atari), which already held 19.8% of the companys shares. In September 2003 the name was changed to Eden Games S.A.S.  Most recently, the studio is known for the Alone in the Dark reboot (2008) and the Test Drive Unlimited series.;{1958, 22283, 7215, 7216, 21303, 107196};Eden Games;;;2015-01-04 00:00:00

2055;392;Clover Studio was an independent Japanese video game development studio funded by Capcom. The studio consisted largely of existing Capcom R&amp D talent, who had formed the company (then called Studio 9) to give themselves greater executive control (and thus creative freedom), like Segas semi-autonomous studios in the early 2000s. The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcoms more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.  Some of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of Ōkami) went to join Ignition Entertainment at their Tokyo development studio.;{5987, 8803, 4229, 4230, 4231, 20744, 1271};Clover Studio;37;{10444};2004-07-01 00:00:00

2262;840;Nippon Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.  NIS America was the result of the companys wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLands Stateside Publisher of the Year Award in 2009.;{15284};NIS America;1405;{20996, 11783, 30221, 5136, 20510, 21538, 44578, 32294, 44078, 24624, 20021, 11831, 21560, 113207, 21577, 20055, 15457, 94306, 7268, 7274, 7275, 7276, 7277, 6767, 7280, 86645, 27258, 44666, 27260, 27261, 74874, 7297, 7298, 7299, 24195, 28289, 9866, 9867, 9868, 103052, 26768, 7319, 7320, 86681, 19099, 27291, 26781, 7842, 9893, 27304, 81576, 19119, 42671, 19634, 77493, 36535, 9914, 7363, 27331, 24262, 119506, 75990, 19163, 25312, 6883, 6887, 86763, 11501, 11503, 21235, 86771, 13557, 13558, 81146, 107260, 24320, 13062, 115989, 78111, 12579, 6948, 23849, 11056, 78128, 7474, 78129, 121651, 121652, 7485, 11589, 11594, 52042, 24909, 19796, 52564, 13657, 11610, 19802, 21851, 19816, 9068, 3966, 9600, 26009, 21406, 8607, 42914, 12195, 2985, 10158, 11694, 82370, 82373, 96198, 26567, 19922, 112082, 16341, 18905, 9694, 11746, 5097, 9708, 25586, 26611, 86514, 25593};2003-12-24 00:00:00

The Golden  Age of hardcore PC simulation titles ended long ago. The past few  years have been lean, with fewer and fewer new products to choose  from and only a handful of studios dedicated to the genre remain.

3188;;Wormwood Studios is a small, international team committed to developing games with distinctive visuals, complex themes, and rich settings.  Wormwood was founded in 2010 by Mark Yohalem, an American writer, and Victor Pflug, an Australian painter.  Along with Greek programmer James Spanos, Victor and Mark spent two years making Primordia, an award-winnning point-and-click adventure game.  In 2013, the team expanded to include Steven Poulton, an English programmer, and Ben Chandler, another Australian artist.  That team made Salt and Like A Raisin in the Sun and worked on the now-defunct adventure game, Cloudscape.  In 2014, the team shifted to include Daniel Miller, a pixel artist dividing his time between Japan and America, Zoltán Tóbiás, a Hungarian artist (and doctor!), and Connor Brennan, an American programmer.  This team is working on Fallen Gods.;{24977, 7635};Wormwood Studios;;;2010-12-31 00:00:00

3772;826;Ultimate Play The Game (often shortened to Ultimate) was a video game developer in the 1980s.  Ultimate released a series of successful games for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX and Commodore 64 computers from 1983 until its closure in 1988. Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles Jetpac and Sabre Wulf, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures utilising a technique termed Filmation. Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as seminal ... revolutionary.  By the time of the labels last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare, and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsofts Xbox One console. In 2006, Rare revived the Ultimate Play The Game name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of Jetpac named Jetpac Refuelled.;{12359, 26249, 26250, 115755, 7852, 26029, 26225, 14102, 26393, 26394, 14588, 13693};Ultimate Play the Game;;{12359, 26249, 26250, 7851, 7852, 26029, 115755, 23057, 26225, 14102, 26393, 26394, 26395, 14588, 13693, 39774};1982-12-31 00:00:00

3808;826;Freejam was founded in Portsmouth, UK by five guys with a solid belief in one simple game idea ‘Robocraft’. We pooled our combined 52 years of traditional games development experience, came up with great idea and by incorporating a new lean-start-up philosophy etched into our brains we were set free to innovate.    We created Freejam to prove truly amazing games can be created through experimentation and evolution. The ‘founding five’ are skilled and organised professional game developers who have embraced the indie way. We are small so we can react fast, listen to our players, make quick decisions, try new stuff out and sculpt our game super efficiently. In the same unrestrained way that musicians write songs, from a simple jam session with a few chords we will create a game that grows into a masterpiece over time with support from our players…    Our journey is a personal experience for the team and we will share our highs and lows with you all on our website and across social media (Facebook, Twitter and Reddit). Our approach relies on open and transparent interaction with our players – we simply can’t make this type of game without input from everyone. We don’t know where Robocraft is going to end up, nor do we know how long it will take, but to be honest that’s all part of the fun.    Give us your voice and help us make the most perfect computer game inspired by everyone.;{7871};Freejam Games;;;

The games are developed by NIGORO members have released as a brand name “NIGORO”. We may also sell on behalf of other game developers. In that case, they have released as a brand name “ASTERIZM”. It is hard to understand. lol.  In the United States, indie Games has considerable demand, and many developers have been successful. In Japan, when it comes to a genre called “DOUJIN”, there are successes. On the other hand when it comes to a genre called “INDIE”, there are few successes. On top of that, indie games themselves are not so popular.  In that circumstances, we have the ambition to be successful Japanese indie games and hope to boost Japanese indie game development field which like-minded people. We are working with such thoughts.

3980;840;The Workshop is a gathering of experienced industry vets intent on making games in a new way. Founded in 2007 by the original founders of Treyarch, The Workshop has a track record of strong engineering, production, art, design and audio services.    -    We believe small, focused, close-knit teams can move mountains. We stay intentionally lean across-the-board: in our office space, management structure, and agile team production techniques. While we have 60+ staff spread across multiple projects, we’re prepared to leverage robust outsourcing pipelines that more than triple our internal capacity.    Our teams focus on collaboration, honest and open communication, and daily sprint reviews of deliverables in progress. We strive for the same close communication and collaboration with our business and development partners.    We proudly encourage our talented employees to participate in game jams, including The Workshop’s internal game jam in 2013 which led to two projects that received internal greenlights for first- (and in one case second-stage) pitch development. We firmly believe our employees are our partners, and that encouraging their creativity both inside and outside the studio makes our teams and our company stronger.    - The Workshop Entertainment;{20114};The Workshop Entertainment;;;2007-12-31 00:00:00

4133;616;11 bit studios, based in Warsaw, Poland, is a multiplatform game development studio selling games worldwide. Our titles have received multiple prestigeous awards throughout the years including: Apple Design Award, Best of PAX and IGN Editors Choice.    -    It all started in 2009, when a bunch of veterans of polish gaming industry joined their forces and founded 11 bit studios. They gathered few talented people and got to work. After a year our first child was born – Anomaly Warzone Earth hit the stores. Quickly it became a huge success, with great sales and number of industry awards, including Apple Design Award.    It was a proof that we were on the right track and in the next few years we repeated the success with Anomaly 2, Anomaly Korea and few other games. But you know what they say – the more you have, the more you want so in 2012 we decided it was time for something bigger.    For the next two years we worked on our upcoming title. Bigger and better than ever before, but what’s even more important – a game that had a potential to touch people. A game that could matter. Something, that hasn’t been done before. A thing to be played and discussed for years to come. In the end of 2014 we were ready and our greatest achievement to this day had it’s premiere. On 14th of November This War of Mine had its release and everything had changed.    The cost of development were covered in first weekend after the premiere, and since then the game keeps being one of the topsellers on Steam and other distribution platforms. The game got over 100 awards and was covered as a phenomenon in the biggest magazines and newspapers all around the world including TIME, EDGE, Washington Post and more.    This brings us to the place where we are today. This War of Mine is still selling really well, being one of the most successful indie titles of the last decade. Our next big game, Frostpunk, is right around the corner and you know what? Again our guts are telling us it will leave a mark. We are crossing the borders and redefining the rules of the genre and that’s the road we want to follow. We believe in creating things instead of just copying them.    Soon you’ll tell us if we achieved what we hoped for.

4780;616;EXOR Studios is an independent game development company officially founded in August 2007 and based in Szczecin, Poland. Unofficially our history dates back to the year 2003 when we gathered as a modding group working on Mods (full game modifications) for Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2.    At this point we are focused entirely on developing and publishing our own original titles for core gaming platforms - PC and consoles. Thanks to the digital publishing revolution we are able to fund our own ideas and create games that we really want to make, without any outside interference.    Our biggest hit so far was Zombie Driver with its console remake Zombie Driver HD which we self-published on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Android and Xbox One. The next upcoming game is titled X-Morph: Defense and will be available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2017. Before X-Morph: Defense and Zombie Driver we worked on a multiplayer car combat game called D.I.P.R.I.P. which was released in 2008 on Steam as one of the first Source Engine mods on the platform.;{120268, 27663, 115991, 9051, 20668};Exor Studios;;{9051, 115991, 120268, 27663};2007-08-01 00:00:00

Project Reality was begun 11 years ago with the objective of bringing a greater sense of reality to EA’s Battlefield franchise style of gameplay.

5847;840;Formerly known as Builder Box, for a few weeks, before changing their name to Hardsuit Labs.  The company was created by employees from Zombie Studios after its closure. They manged to get the rights to some of the games they had worked on previously including Blaclklight: Retribution.    Paradox Interactive has a minor stake in the company while it remains independent.    Hardsuit Labs, located in Seattle, was founded in 2015 with the same goal as every other game development studio that has ever existed – to make great games. What sets us apart is the way we make that happen:    It’s all about our people.    It takes talented, driven people to make great games. Here at Hardsuit Labs, we work hard to create and to maintain an environment that not only attracts those people and keeps them here, but that allows them to thrive and to do what they do best – to make great games. It’s not always as easy as it sounds, but it really is that simple.;{116530, 2118};Hardsuit Labs;8623;;2015-01-01 00:00:00

5909;840;Wisdom Tree is a Christian gaming company originally called Color Dreams. They basically took some of their Color Dreams games and added Bible themes. These games didnt just rip off their own games. Eventually, Nintendo found out about all these games being made without their permission. When the SNES was released, they installed a lockout chip allowing only licensed games to play. Wisdom Tree got around this by creating the Wolfenstien clone, Super Noahs Ark 3D. by inserting a licensed game into the top of it, it overrode the lockout chip.;{11168, 28267, 4462, 11163, 11165, 11166};Wisdom Tree;;{11168, 4462, 11163, 11164, 11165, 11166};1981-12-31 00:00:00

As a Microsoft first-party studio, they are dedicated to pushing the limits of interactive entertainment and taking Gears of War to new heights.

7466;752;Paradox Development Studio is based on the heritage of the Swedish board game company Target Games, and has been a game developer of PC-focused grand strategy games since 1995, including the Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, and Victoria series. The company continued to create PC games and in 1999, the company was divided into two separate entities: Paradox Interactive, which focused on creating grand strategy games for PC, and Paradox Entertainment, which focused on creating board and role-playing games.    In January 2012, the company divided yet again into two companies, becoming Paradox Interactive and Paradox Development Studio. Paradox Interactive became the game publisher focused on PC games of various genres and Paradox Development Studio became the game development studio focused on grand strategy games.    The game development studio was one of the first video game developers to create games in the grand strategy genre, and most of the games the studio has developed falls into that category. Grand strategy games are historical strategy games that usually cover the entire world map and include elements such as economy, diplomacy and warfare.;{27520, 54528, 119427, 22660, 22661, 22662, 22663, 22664, 22665, 22666, 22667, 22668, 4109, 4110, 22669, 52996, 53002, 53005, 119187, 15894, 124954, 10397, 10398, 10399, 10400, 10401, 110889, 10282, 10283, 10284, 10285, 23850, 23980, 27053, 27946, 102060, 111150, 27829, 7607, 27833, 26426, 11582, 119428, 452, 112587, 2387, 19294, 25566, 4577, 19298, 19299, 111331, 2918, 2022, 5734, 5735, 2922, 51815, 90095, 1904, 115063, 2936, 18300, 17023};Paradox Development Studio;517;;1995-01-01 00:00:00

7693;840;Butterscotch Shenanigans is a fiercely independent game studio of three brothers (Adam, Seth, Sam) located in St. Louis, MO and Dallas, TX. We make mechanically tight, aesthetically pleasing, loop-driven games with a dash of story and a heaping ladle of absurdity. Our core game portfolio (Quadropus Rampage, Towelfight 2, Flop Rocket, and Roid Rage) is primarily designed for mobile, though we are shifting towards platform-agnosticism (meaning our games will play just as well on mobile and desktop) starting with our upcoming title, Crashlands. What allows this transtion is our new game service, BscotchID, now integrated into our core portfolio on iTunes and Google Play.;{23402, 39180, 15389, 59861, 113365, 113366, 101245};Butterscotch Shenanigans;;{23402, 39180, 15389, 59861, 113365, 113366, 101245};

7792;840;Soma was created in direct response to what we like to call “God’s nudge.” One day an article appeared in the news talking about a new trend, Christian video games. Following the link lead to the Christian Game Developers Conference. Registering for the event lead (within about 10 minutes) to an invitation to go to Boston and appear on TV – to discuss Christian video games and how this trend mashes up against games like Grand Theft Auto. Literally in the course of a single week, Soma Games came into being and the story continues.

7829;380;Santa Ragione is an Italian micro game design studio founded by Pietro Righi Riva and Nicolò Tedeschi in 2010, creators of FOTONICA, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Santa Ragione’s games focus on achieving a visceral response from the player, whether through the desolate landscapes of MirrorMoon EP, the uncompromising, vertigo-inducing speeds of FOTONICA, or the controversial politics in Wheels of Aurelia. The studio has a unique, experimental approach to accessibility that encourages exploration and personal interpretation, to achieve surprising depth. Santa Ragione’s inspiration comes equally from literature classics, evocative electronica, and contemporary art, to strive and stand out stylistically and continue the tradition of Italian design.;{15544, 16692, 24463};Santa Ragione;;{15544, 16692, 24463};2010-12-31 00:00:00

8460;250;The Game Bakers is an independent video game studio founded by Emeric Thoa and Audrey Leprince. To sum it up they often say that they make games like they cook food: with a lot of love. They want to create that experience that players remember, that they will have fantasies about long after the game is finished, and that makes them feel alive and energized. The studio is based in Montpellier in France – right above a bakery – but they work as a studio in the clouds with a team of collaborators around the world.;{17026, 53090, 115427, 19877, 19878, 19879};The Game Bakers;;{17026, 115427, 19877, 53090};2010-08-08 00:00:00

9064;840;Stephen Alexander and Jordan Thomas collaborated closely throughout BioShock and BioShock Infinite’s development. After BioShock, Jordan led BioShock 2 and then returned to Boston for BioShock Infinite. When the latter project shipped in 2013, they decided to continue making games together and formed Question LLC. Not too long after, they were joined by Kain Shin, an engineer who specializes in player-enabling systems. After shipping The Magic Circle they were joined by Michael Patches Kelly, who brings with him a strong production and design background, and David Pittman, an engineer and designer with a wide range of experience in AAA and as an independent developer. In late 2017, veteran game developer Jeff Lake joined the team to add further engineering expertise, an air of gravitas, and enthusiasm for cargo shorts.    They draw on a long history of games with strong central narratives & diverse player-enabling systems with the goal of attempting to create new experiences in the same vein, but on a smaller scale.;{89562, 17847};Question;;{89562, 17847};2013-07-01 00:00:00

9440;250;The team behind Out There is composed of Mi-Clos Studio, which is lead by Michael Peiffert, and FibreTigre. Together, they have launched the mobile hit Out There to the universe.        Michael Peiffert was a senior art director in the web design industry. In the past, he has won several prizes for his work on user-experience and design. In 2010, he founded his one-man company, Mi Clos Studio, and began his career in the game design industry. His first game was released in 2011: Space Disorder. Michael loves Doom and is the 15th best player in France on the Xbox Live Street Fighter IV. FibreTigre has been writing interactive fiction for 12 years and has released a couple of serious/experimental games. He has written about video games in French publications, such as Wired France. FibreTigre loves turn-based games such as Gladius and X-Com and has finished both Dark Souls. Michael and FibreTigre met twice, first when Michael was pitching Space Disorder at a lecture, then when FibreTigre made a lecture about Gamebooks and their influence on modern video games. Since they both loved sci-fi, they agreed to embark on the Nomad for the Out There adventure. During Out There, FibreTigre crafted the text and the game design, whereas Michael took care about everything else: coding, art direction, graphic assets and communication. They created Out There with nearly no budget, working part time. Difficult times, but these difficulties reflected in the harsh perils and loneliness the players can experience with Out There.    Based in Lyon, France;{9539, 59079};Mi-Clos Studio;;{9539, 35047, 59079, 18451, 25941, 36127};2011-05-01 00:00:00

9475;;We have been developing in VR since late 2012. A successful Kickstarter campaign in the Spring of 2013 gave us the mandate to create the first-ever announced, built for VR game, The Gallery: Six Elements. Now, with multiple years under our belt, we have the knowledge, conviction and tenacity, to make the best immersive VR experiences available. Our foundational code base and proprietary technology give us a giant leap forward in creating interactive experiences, while we continue to hone our VR sensibilities, making Cloudhead one of the best interactive VR studios in the world today.  As pioneers in VR development, we are on a mission to create fully interactive and immersive VR experiences that set a new standard – across all platforms including HTC Vive, Oculus VR, Sony Project Morpheus, Samsung Gear, and those yet to be released. Because we’ve been developing since 2012, we fully comprehend the implications and sensibilities of VR to create the most profound experiences.;{17452, 119341};Cloudhead Games;;{17452, 119341};2012-12-31 00:00:00

Joining Ditto on GoNNER is sound designer Martin Kvale, who met Ditto by the purest of luck at a visual arts festival in Karlshamn, Sweden, when he mistakenly thought Ditto was a different friend of his. A few drinks later, it didnt matter anymore. Joar Renolen, a talented composer and longtime friend of Martins, joined the team shortly after.;{19002};Art in Heart;0;;

Feel the rush of battle, the awe of exploration, and the exhilaration of imaginary futures and recreated pasts.    The name Survios comes from the English prefix sur meaning above, beyond and the Greek βίος meaning life, reality — taken literally, Survios means Beyond Reality. And this is exactly where we think the future is headed.;{81056, 19169, 118306, 121924, 27506, 118485, 102134};Survios;;{81056, 19169, 118306, 27506, 118485, 102134};

9938;752;Talecore Studios was founded in late October 2015 by Anna Jenelius, a QA manager who decided to quit her job and go indie. The focus, she decided, would be games with emphasis on narrative and simple but robust design. She already had a small part time project, Capitals, running with Sebastian Alonzo and Markus Hellström - but the time had come to make games with all engines running on full throttle.   Talecore Studio’s goal is to create experiences that engage the heart and challenge the brain - experiences that make you feel and think. The studio will not hesitate to deal with heavy subjects and more mature themes than you might be used to from other games. Just like literature and movies can range from comedy via the very dark to the thought-provoking, so should games. It is simply a part of the industry showing that it is growing up.;;Talecore Studios;;{19281};2016-05-01 00:00:00

9964;191;Just1337, is a newly formed Croatian video-game studio, It was formed as a small company under a bit older, but very successful company called Kupi Key, that specializes in selling and distributing video games. Being in that kind of business never really put any restrictions what the targeted market or the audience is. Kupi Key was formed in 2012, by one person, Jurica Šinko, being a little genius he is, he soon started being very successful and he realized that way more opportunities lie in making his own video games. In May 2015. he took a risk and formed Just1337 Studio, putting together 4 friends, on a mission to create their own video games, that they all so love and on who they grow up. The learning process, making the team work together, understanding what the market standards are, took about 5 months, and in October 2015 the first game was ready for release. Since then, some things of course changed and the team grow even bigger. The studio is focusing more on 2D games for now, with a big appetite to go into 3D in time. That being said, both games that this studio has behind them are 2D, each evolving in a incredible pace and complexity. Big things lay in front of us, so stay tuned.;{32707, 30501, 30122, 29579, 20367, 30128, 21970, 22386, 29694, 30487, 19325, 19326};Just1337 Studio;;;2015-12-31 00:00:00

10021;840;Frontwire Studios is an independent game studio with a mission to change the way the video game industry interacts with and engages it’s community. For too long have video game developers designed the games they wanted, without actually taking the time to make the game their community desired.    Long gone are the days of ignoring the community. Frontwire Studios is taking a stand and saying enough is enough. We realize that the community is our life, and without the community we have no purpose. That’s why we are developing the games our community not only want but deserve, by polling our users on features and concepts each step of the way in order to ensure that the final product is everything our fans desire.    At the end of the day, we’re not developing our game. We’re building yours.;{19436};Frontwire Studios;;{19436};2016-04-29 00:00:00

Both are passionate about video games, and started playing them pretty much right after they got that whole walking thing down. The whole project came to be in March of 2015, shortly after the announcement from Epic that the Unreal Engine 4 is now free to use. After a long campaign in Divinity: Original Sin together, Greg mentioned to Chip that he wanted to try making video games instead of just playing them, and Chip followed suit.;{19604};Scraping Bottom Games;;{19604};2015-12-31 00:00:00

The goal then was to create a space where skilled and dedicated game developers could work and learn together without suffering from the unhealthy employment- and business practices so common in large-scale game development.    Throughout the years, we have learned, grown and attracted more talent – allowing us to design and implement solutions to problems across a variety of hardware platforms, be it PC & Console-, Browser- or Mobile Games.    We are continuously adding new interesting projects to our track record and are eager to enhance our knowledge and skillset in an ever-changing industry. Our artistic vision, technical prowess and professional rigor is reflected by the quality of our product and the good relationships that connect us to partners and players worldwide.;{26674};Mipumi Games;;{26674};2009-12-31 00:00:00

10489;191;Pine Studio is a small game dev studio from Croatia who started in 2012, in a garage. They have a diverse portfolio, but the project which began it all was a turn based strategy - Perishing Sun. The project was too big of a challenge for the young team, and it was never released. After that, Pine Studio started making smaller mobile games, and they have released over 30 of them by now. Although their specialties are a cute adventure and point n click games, their last project is something completely different. SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is the world’s only competitive heavy metal first-person platformer. Like a bastard child of Quake 3 and Super Meat Boy, SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is truly hardcore and focuses on speed and fast reaction. SEUM was released on Steam July, 2016. Pine Studio is now working on mobile game: Faraway. In Faraway youre an adventurer exploring ruins of ancient temples full of challenges and mysterious puzzles.;{104676, 105800, 21993, 101737, 102700, 115052, 117499, 95645};Pine Studio;;{105800, 101737, 117499};2012-12-31 00:00:00

All over the world the tradition of storytelling, through simple stories, has been passed down through generations to teach values that enrich our lives. As parents we want our children to hear the same stories which inspired and entertained us when we were growing up. However, kids today are much harder to please. They demand highly engaging experiences!    Gamaya’s unique blend of the real and virtual world brings folktales and stories of the past to life. Through 3D animated cartoons & toys that come alive in a video game, your kids will enjoy the world of folklore like never before.;{22721};Gamaya Inc;;{22721};

Whether your game is VR, pixel art, cute, or grim we have a plan to get your game onto a truly global market.

10895;380;The studio was originally set up by group of friends and professionals who share common ideas on game development and are united by the passion for the survival horror genre (and the games of the Resident Evil series in particular).    At that time, the studio worked on “Resident Evil 2 Reborn”, an unofficial remake of Capcom’s 1998 classic – which has drawn more than 1 million views on YouTube in few weeks. The project was interrupted when the official Resident Evil 2 remake was announced in 2015, but Invader Studios received an invitation from Capcom Ltd. to visit their headquarters in Osaka, Japan.    Currently, the team is focusing on the production of its first survival horror game, “Daymare: 1998”™ (Q2 2019 – PC Steam, Xbox ONE and PlayStation 4) as well as a virtual reality project for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.;{23891};Invader Studios;;;

12027;156;Spotlightor is an indie game studio based in Beijing, dedicated to creating innovative games, which provide unique experiences and meaningful insights.      Spotlightor was founded in 2009 by Gao Ming and Ma Xiaoyu. They began the cooperation in university and made several interactive installations and indie games together. After they graduated from university, there were very few interactive design agencies in China – they considered it as a good chance and founded Spotlightor Interactive. After 4 years hard working in the interactive design area, Spotlightor grew up into a small and professional interactive design studio.    After that - Indie games  Gao Ming decided to devote himself to game design career before he entered university. In the first 4 years of Spotlightor, he kept making game prototypes during free time, participating in Ludum Dare game jams, and embedding game elements in commercial interactive design projects. After 4 years, Spotlightor had gained enough experience through commercial projects and some money to start indie projects – it was time to chase another dream, a dream of indie games. In 2013, Spotlightor started a plan called “Crazy Friday” – each Friday, we stopped all commercial projects and made indie games instead. Since then, Spotlightor started its journey of indie games. After 1 year, Chrono Express was born and released on Apple App Store.;{27035, 106278, 81247};Spotlightor Interactive;;{81247};2009-12-31 00:00:00

12831;616;Moral Anxiety Studio is an independent game development project led by Aureus, a Polish writer and designer. While none of the released games were made by a single person, Aureus is happy to stand behind the stories, designs, art direction and worldbuilding and he considers himself to be the creator of these games.    Aureus is building his own style of storytelling in video games, especially by focusing on small, personal tragedies, which he presents through complex dialogues. The games take place in Viaticum, a fantasy setting that has been under development for over 10 years.;{55114, 118875, 36596};Moral Anxiety Studio;8623;{55114, 118875};2016-12-31 00:00:00

13091;840;Renegade was founded in 2014 in San Diego, CA by industry veteran Scott Gaeta. Scotts over 20 years of experience enabled Renegade to gain a foothold immediately, releasing award-winning products and igniting a new era of casual games.    Scott entered the industry on the retail side, opening a game store in 1996. The store flourished in the golden age of CCGs, and later expanded into minis and board games. From there he starting consulting for Decipher, cutting his teeth on popular products such as the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Lord of the Rings CCGs. Scott eventually sold his store and became Deciphers Senior Vice President. Years later, he moved to Upper Deck Entertainment as Senior Director, tackling tabletop products based on Yu-Gi-Oh!, DC Comics, World of Warcraft, Marvel Comics, Hello Kitty and more.    After a great run at both companies, Scott decided it was time to build a game company from the ground up. In 2010, Scott co-founded Cryptozoic Entertainment with his partners. The company exploded onto the scene, with products ranging from World of Warcraft CCG expansions to various licensed tabletop games. In 2014, Scott decided to leave the company he co-founded and move on to a new challenge of bringing hobby quality games to the masses. Scott founded Renegade Game Studios in 2014.;;Renegade Game Studios;;{45248, 45249};2014-12-31 00:00:00

13648;392;Sony Music Entertainment Japans game publishing label.    In recent years game development has progressed to a point where it is possible to develop high-quality games with even a small team.  In addition, with the evolution of digital publishing, it has become relatively easy to distribute titles to users all over the world.  Independently developed and published games has become the trend in game development, especially in Europe and the United States.    This trend is also creating situations where creative indie titles and releases made by creators are buried without being notice.    At Unties, we help bring these masterpieces to light.

14064;;Ruby Party (ルビー・パーティー) is a video game developing team working for Koei that focus on the companys popular romance-adventure series for their female consumers (known now as their Neo Romance series —ネオロマンスシリーズ— to respect male fans).    The team is famous for producing the first romance title targeting the female market in Japan, starting the trend for the Otome game genre. Members of the team are known to be predominately female, but the structure has changed over the years to include male developers. The teams name is meant to highlight the female members since rubies are considered the queen of gems and represent passionate love.    Ruby Party also partakes or supervises the various media made based on their products such as the drama CDs, light novels, magazine publications, radio programs, live events, talk shows, comics, and anime. Select animated and comic adaptations have been localized overseas, but the games have largely remained in Japan —aside from a few rare exceptions. If enough interest arises for their games, there may be a chance someday they will be brought overseas and translated into English.    As of April 1, 2016, Ruby Party doubles as a brand name for the companys romantic simulations, merchandise, licenses for multimedia projects, and stage event management. Mei Erikawa, Kou Shibusawa and Keiko Erikawas eldest daughter, is the director for the Ruby Party brand.;{49570, 72678, 49447, 72680, 72681, 78157, 78158, 121519, 59958, 45435, 45437};Ruby Party;8482;;

We found shelter from the great halls of Kajaani University of Applied Sciences where we discovered each other and worked on our prize-winning local fighting VR-game Nemesis Perspective.

The studio is continually exploring various genres of games as seen on examples like Lums - physics based puzzle game about light and shadows, Oh My Heart - brutal pixel art action game, Perfect Paths - programming logic puzzler, Chameleon Run - super fast award winning auto-runner or soon to be released VR rhythm game Beat Saber. Also, many of our games come from ideas born during various game jams in which we participates a lot.;{58656, 83731};Hyperbolic Magnetism;;{83731};1997-09-01 00:00:00

14692;392;SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS CO., LTD. is the holdings company for all Square Enix businesses and subsidiaries.    The holding company was created in 2008 when the main Japanese company, SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD., was split into a pure holdings company and a separate succeeding business taking over all previous rights and obligations.    This was done by renaming the original company as a holdings company and creating a new business with the original name to take over all ongoing work. This process leaves most operations unchanged while creating a separate company for shareholders without interrupting normal business operations.      Since the holdings company is the new business, while the original companies name is used to continue the business without interruption, the original companies page has not been changed/recreated.;;SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS CO., LTD.;14509;;2008-10-01 00:00:00

14737;;“Periscope Games” is a game development studio that came to exist from the merging between PR:WW2 (an add-on crew from the Battlefield 2 mod Project Reality) and Liberty’s Highway (a modding team from SQUAD).    Firstly known as a modding group for Squad, our ambition and expectation for Post Scriptum rapidly made us realize that we would have to create our own studio in order to reach those goals and fulfill this vision of ours. Such things would not be doable in a respectable time frame without us going full time on the project, and as such, get a living from it.;{81141};Periscope Games;;{113658, 110667};2016-12-31 00:00:00

14924;862;Established in Venezuela in 2012, 3D Avenue is a Video Game Development Studio founded by very passionate gamers focused on creating great and exciting games from design to release and beyond. We have two published and released games  Nanomites which is our first arcade game ever released on mobile devices and Spectrum, an abstract and challenging platformer available on iOS, Android and Steam.;{34009};3D Avenue;;{34009};2012-12-31 00:00:00
14925;;The first time we both were exposed to video games, was when our mom busted out her old Nintendo with Mario and Duck Hunt when we were 4 years old. We were hooked immediately. Ever since, we played video games every day (if we could help it). As time passed, we got really good at playing games, and loved the really challenging games. Growing up we loved to play games like Mortal Kombat Mythologies Subzero, Berzerk, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire, and Crash Bandicoot 2, but of course the list goes on. Thanks to our parents, who would force us to go outside to do something unrelated to the TV, we also really liked to ride dirt bikes, go for hikes, camp, and swim. Needless to say, we spend almost all our time together, so usually running into one of us means getting the 2 for 1 special. Eventually we both started making games together, though they were usually pretty bad at first, they taught us all we needed to know to begin creating a real game.;{80745};Ettinsoft;;{80745};2018-02-26 00:00:00

15343;840;6 Eyes studio is an independent game studio established in 2015 by the happily married couple Pierre Leclerc (programmer) and Christina Leclerc (pixel artist). They had previously worked in the video game and tabletop industries (EA, Activision, Gameloft, Topps Digital, Judges Guild, Studio Archcraft and freelancing) for about 15 years.    After Studio Archcraft, the independent game studio responsible for Black Sigil: Blade of the Exiled, disbanded, the couple kept working in the industry for big names, while carefully planning for Fell Seal: Arbiters Mark. In 2015, the time was ripe and they officially started working on the title.    The Studios goal is to create fun and engaging titles by marrying modern design strategies with time-tested classic gameplay and, generally speaking, to do it using modern and vibrant 2D art.;{55771};6 Eyes Studio;;;2015-12-31 00:00:00

15357;616;Our ambition is to create a game that stands out from other indie RPG games through the quality of graphics, focus on an engaging and unique story, attention to detail, and few innovative solutions when it comes to game mechanics. Most notably, we developed a new class progression system and tactical real-time combat with slow-time mode, where understanding the differences and synergies between the classes and their customization is necessary to overcome the challenges encountered in the Tower. Enemies can surround you, target your weakest champions and position themselves at tactically-optimal locations.    We are a fully independent and fully self-funded studio, without any publisher behind us. Wish us luck!;{121588, 27359};Event Horizon;;{121588, 27359};

When creating a game we know whats fun, we have been playing and creating games since the first computers came available to the people. From simple text-based games to the latest ones out on the market now.    Our knowledge in design goes all the way back to when a website was just a mouseover button and a few gif animations and when bulletin boards was the hottest thing on the market.    As you now have guessed, we are not the youngest team on the market. But we are still young at heart and mind.

17917;392;YUKITO Products Inc. is the studio created by Yukito Kishiro, creator of the GUNNM series known as Battle Angel Alita internationally, and Tsutomu Kishiro, his younger brother and manga assistant.    Credited as the developer for GUNNM: Martian Memory.  It was made with the purpose of telling the story he had been unable to finish in the GUNNM manga which had been cut short due to personal reasons.  Some story elements from the game were later expanded on when the manga series continued in GUNNM: Last Order.;{23152};YUKITO Products Inc.;8623;;

17999;40;We’re a small independent studio from Vienna, Austria. For the past five years we have worked together as a tight-knit team and developed our games - YoKaisho and NIVA - which were honored with various international awards and nominations. We thrive to create family friendly experiences which captivate our players through their curious game mechanics and mesmerizing art style. We are currently working on our next game: Weaving Tides.;{118076, 97303};Follow the Feathers;;{118076};
18000;76;We’re a game development studio creating games that bring people together. We have over 5 years of experience creating games for multiple platforms. Originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we are a completely remote studio with coworkers from different cities and even some digital nomads.  We believe games have an engagement power that is unlike any other medium. We focus on creating experiences that can leverage that social aspect. We specialize in multiplayer games, online or offline, community-based products and virtual reality experiences.;{115066};BitCake Studio;;{115066};2013-12-31 00:00:00

18534;840;ionos Software Development and Publishing Partners, Inc. of Scottsdale, Arizona, with developers from California to Belgium, is breaking new ground in the interactive entertainment and Internet software industry.  Headed by industry veterans and boasting a truly innovative developer relations model, ionos is the place where developers are treated as true partners throughout the products lifespan, from development and production to marketing and sales.    Nothing is more representative of its commitment to developer partnerships than ionos unique publishing model that splits profits evenly with developers. 50/50 -- thats an unprecedented figure at this level of the industry. Match that with a sales operation focused on every known and some yet-unknown sales channels, and the result is a company focused on matching truly original titles and talent with an innovative business model. For too long, publishers have been a restrictive presence in the interactive entertainment and software industry. ionos provides the one place where developers and their ideas can move freely without resistance.    Founded in 1996, ionos is headed by industry veteran Mario Vassaux. Formerly the Director of Operations for FormGen, Vassaux was part of the team that launched such notable titles as Wolfenstein: Spear of Destiny, and Duke Nukem 3D. Vassaux formed ionos after GT Interactive Software, in a multi-million dollar acquisition, purchased FormGen in 1996. Joining Vassaux at ionos is Adam Brüss. Brüss, V.P. of Sales and Marketing, has been a top marketing executive at a number of successful consumer software companies including Automap, Inc., MicroBase, and Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.    ionos has been extremely busy right from the start. In February of 1997, ionos acquired Mediatechnics from GT Interactive Software, immediately gaining the profitability of the Mediatechnics division. Mediatechnics software manufacturing operation gives ionos software publishing division increased profitability by allowing it to closely hold the line on costs and better respond to market conditions for all the products it publishes.    ionos has also debuted several hot titles for the fall gaming season, ranging from the critically acclaimed funky business-simulator Zapitalism, to LEDWars, a real-time strategy title featuring top-notch Artificial Intelligence, as well as Demonstar, one of the first titles to utilize force-feedback joystick technology.;;Ionos, Inc;;{9117};1996-12-25 00:00:00

18897;528;Degoma is a videogame company founded by two siblings, Frank and Gloria. Frank is a long time gamer with extensive studies in music composing and game development. Platformers are his thing. Gloria is a software engineer who is also interested in the narrative aspect of games. They started to play around with game development already in secondary school, when they made amateur adventure games and even some incursions in the Mario fangaming world. Many years after, degoma has developed into a well established company with a full network of freelancers and colaborators which help to make Reggie a solid reality. Reggie is degoma main focus right now, but they have many more ideas under the sleeve.;;Degoma;;;

Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004. In 2010, RealNetworks re-branded its games division under the name Gamehouse. It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook applets, and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.;;RealNetworks;;;1994-12-31 00:00:00
